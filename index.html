<h1 id="from-reactive-to-proactive">From Reactive to Proactive</h1>
<p>Cybersecurity often gets <strong>stuck</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>triaging the same types of alerts and events that came yesterday</li>
<li>gathering the same kind of data to answer questions that were asked for last audit</li>
<li>finding more of the same classes of security bugs in software</li>
<li>playing whack-a-mole patching the worst vulnerabilities</li>
<li>writing up risks similar to ones found during the last business initiative</li>
</ul>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t in cybersecurity, you&rsquo;ve probably seen a similar predicament in your domain. When a team is constantly in <strong>reactive mode</strong>, it feels inescapable. <em>I can&rsquo;t drop any of these required activities. Where would I find the time to change things?&quot;</em> But finding a time to invest in <strong>doing less of these activities</strong> is the only way to break the cycle.</p>
<p><a href="https://openandsecure.com/">In my work with organizations</a>, I use a several methods to break this cycle, but I want to share one option with you here: <strong>routine postmortems</strong>.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re likely familiar with a variety of techniques for diagnosing how something went wrong. <em>Five Whys</em>, <em>Root Cause Analysis</em>, <em>Blameless Postmortems</em>, and more. If run well, these can be a very powerful tool for understanding the process, system, and even cultural problems that led to a breakdown. They also level up the organization through knowledge sharing and by implementing changes that stop the same type of problem from resurfacing.</p>
<p>However, if your organization is in <strong>reactive mode</strong>, you probably don&rsquo;t feel like you have the bandwidth to perform these analyses for all but the very worst of events, and even when you do, you struggle to find time to implement any changes that would prevent the problem from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Shifting from ineffective formal emergency retrospectives to ongoing proactive analysis requires a <strong>cultural shift</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Routine Postmortems</strong> allow you to start to build the change into the fabric of your organization.</p>
<h1 id="implementing">Implementing</h1>
<p>Start small. Select a recurring time for the team to meet (somewhere between weekly and quarterly), or reserve some time in an existing meeting cadence. In preparation for the meeting, the team(s) should bring <strong>one</strong> reactive event from the last period for each functional area, along with an initial analysis. They should not spend much time on the analysis (less than the meeting itself is booked for). It&rsquo;s better if these are not full emergency incidents. For example, within cybersecurity, items could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a SOC alert</li>
<li>an audit or pentest finding</li>
<li>a vulnerability</li>
<li>a configuration error</li>
<li>a design weakness</li>
<li>an unmitigated risk</li>
</ul>
<p>Walk through a light version of your chosen diagnostic process, giving extra opportunity for team members to ask questions with nonjudgmental curiosity and to chime in with additional ideas on what upstream changes could have avoided the problem.</p>
<p>Go through as many categories as you have time to go through, but it&rsquo;s ok if it&rsquo;s just one! (<em>Simply rotate the focus category next time.</em>)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better if this isn&rsquo;t heavy with formality, but it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to jot down takeaways and decisions.</p>
<h1 id="when-its-working">When It&rsquo;s Working</h1>
<ul>
<li>preparing for the meeting, and <em>even knowing they will be preparing for the meeting</em>, gets people re-orienting their mindset towards problem prevention over firefighting</li>
<li>silos of problem-responding are breaking down, people are learning from each other, and solutions (which often require cross-team collaboration) are emerging</li>
<li>people are seeing that &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&rdquo;, and that the effort invested is freeing up time for more strategic work</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="failure-modes">Failure Modes</h1>
<p><strong>Blamestorming</strong>: it&rsquo;s tempting to criticize an initial analysis or to focus on people instead of problems. Use your facilitation skills to align the conversation to the future, not to the past. Practicing this routine will help the team improve at both analysis and problem-solving.</p>
<p><strong>Giving Up on Ops</strong>: routine postmortems aren&rsquo;t an excuse to stop responding entirely. Remember this is a method to carve out a slice of time to turn the ship.</p>
<p><strong>Lack of Follow-Through</strong>: if people are having great ideas, but nothing is changing, then you likely have execution problems. That&rsquo;s another topic, but one thing you can try is picking the quickest win from each session and making sure the right person has ownership to drive that result.</p>
<p><strong>Something Else?</strong>: If you&rsquo;ve tried this and run into other problems that you want to debug, <a href="https://openandsecure.com/">I&rsquo;m happy to help!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Soon the national and international media was flooding in, trying to understand who and what the “Zizians” were. A “trans vegan death cult”? An “offshoot of the rationalist movement”? An “antifascist cult”? Anarchists? The events were immediately sucked up into the maw of the culture-war machine, recycled as a story of wokeness gone wild, a story of police overreach, an immigration story, or one about the inevitable product of an anti-trans culture.</p>

			 <p>Like a lot of card games, there are variants depending on where you grew up, who you played with, etc.</p>
<p>Tonight, I learned a somewhat boggling (but also interesting) one: &ldquo;going under&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going under&rdquo; means that when it is your term to bid (which is a yes/no or suit declaration in Euchre, rather than a number), you can sacrifice your bid to take three 9s or 10s from your hand and exchange them with the kitty. The extra interesting part of this is that the people I learned it from say you never show the cards you exchange with the kitty. I&rsquo;m sure many players have taken advantage of that fact.</p>
<p>I grew up with something a little different. If you had all 9s and 10s, you could show them and declare &ldquo;Farmers Hand&rdquo; which became a misdeal, and thus, the deal passed to the next player.</p>
<p>Have you used any rules like this? What was your variation?</p>

			 <p>Learned another game this weekend: <strong>Tens</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<p>You need enough decks (without Jokers) for all players to have 19 cards. Shuffle &rsquo;em up.</p>
<p>Each player grabs a pile of cards from the deck and makes 4 stacks in front of them, as well as a hand of cards. Each stack has one face-down card on the bottom and one face-up card on the top. The other 11 cards go in their hand. Anyone who grabbed exactly 19 cards, gets -10 points (this is good!) for this round. Any player that didn&rsquo;t pull exactly 19 cards makes up the difference using the deck.</p>
<p>Play starts with whoever pulled closest to 19 cards, and goes clockwise. The first player is suggested to be whoever had closest to 19 cards.</p>
<h1 id="eligible-plays">Eligible Plays</h1>
<p>Cards are played into a central pile. A player may play as many cards of a rank as they like, using a combination of their face-up cards and cards in their hand. They may alternatively play an uncovered <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> face down card, and, after seeing what it is, add as many matching face-up or hand cards as they like.</p>
<h1 id="results-of-a-play">Results of a Play</h1>
<p>Any time the count of cards of the current rank on the pile becomes 4 or more (e.g. five Jacks), or a Ten is played, the current player discards the entire pile and takes an additional turn.</p>
<p>If they played at the current rank or lower (and there are still less than 4 of that rank on top), play moves to the next player.</p>
<p>However, if they played a card <em>higher</em> than the current rank (other than a Ten), the player must take the whole pile into their hand and play another turn.</p>
<h1 id="ending-the-round-and-scoring">Ending the Round and Scoring</h1>
<p>Once a player gets rid of all their cards (stacks and hand), play stops for the round. That player gets 0 points for the round, and everyone else is penalized for all of their remaining cards. Cards are scored by their rank value, with Aces being 1, Jack 11, Queen 12, King 13, and Tens 20. (<em>Don&rsquo;t forget the -10 for any player that pulled exactly 19 cards when setting up the round.</em>)</p>
<h1 id="winning">Winning</h1>
<p>Play more rounds, but one suggestion is to play until someone has hit 100 (ten tens).</p>
<p>Whoever has the fewest points at the end wins!</p>

			 <p><em>other 2024 reviews <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2025/01/06/reviews-collection.html">here</a></em></p>
<hr>
<p>2024 was the year that I found out that iTunes Match and Apple Music were &ldquo;eating&rdquo; my music by dropping files, replacing with different editions/formats, or failing to sync some material. I already knew that Google did terrible things when going from Google Play Music to Youtube music, but Apple was a surprise to me. I resolved to not let such things happen any more.</p>
<p>I set out to rebuild my library by:</p>
<ul>
<li>re-downloading lossless versions of my <a href="https://bandcamp.com/screamsandreams">Bandcamp</a> purchases</li>
<li>getting the best format download from other places I&rsquo;d bought digital music</li>
<li>re-ripping our CDs in lossless format</li>
<li>backing it all up</li>
<li>normalizing metadata with <a href="https://picard.musicbrainz.org">MusicBrainz Picard</a></li>
<li>running <a href="https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/">Plex Media Server</a> to share the music</li>
<li>running <a href="https://tailscale.com">Tailscale</a> to make the server available without putting it directly on the web</li>
<li>running <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/">PlexAmp</a> clients for an <strong>awesome</strong> listening experience</li>
<li>scrobbling my listening with <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams/listening-report/year">last.fm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not finished with the project, but I have over 200 artists, 600 albums, and 6000 tracks re-deployed, with much more to come. Because I&rsquo;m not complete, the listening may not have as much variety as it could have.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2025/top-listens.jpg" alt="Artists: Clubroot, Juno Reactor, NIN, Circle of Dust, Front Line Assembly; Albums: HolyName, Excursions&hellip;, Imagination&hellip;, Celldweller, A Homeland Denied; Tracks: The Straight and Narrow, Hammer &amp; Gavel, Low Pressure Zone, HATEFUL, Listen!"></p>
<p>Artists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clubroot is my go-to for evening chillout music</li>
<li>Juno Reactor is a constant fave</li>
<li>3-5 are prolific industrial-ish artists that use various project pseudonyms, and I listen to a lot of each</li>
</ul>
<p>Albums:</p>
<ul>
<li>HolyName&rsquo;s self-titled is sorta doomcore taize and is a great Sunday listen</li>
<li><em>Excursions</em> is a collection of early Front Line Assembly side-project work</li>
<li><em>Imagine&hellip;</em> is a re-release of Juno Reactor&rsquo;s first 5 albums as a compilation</li>
<li>Celldweller is another project from Circle of Dust (Klayton/Scott) which has probably eclipsed CoD</li>
<li><em>A Homeland Denied</em> was a hardcore compilation as benefit for Palestinians</li>
<li>Trans-Siberian Orchestra broke in for me this year, mostly because of their Christmas music</li>
</ul>
<p>Tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 and 3 are a couple of those excellent Clubroot grooves</li>
<li>Hammer &amp; Gavel is a prophetic anthem from a 2-person wall of sound I discovered this year (American Arson)</li>
<li>HATEFUL is a single from HEALTH and my favorite thing from them so far</li>
<li>Listen! was one of my &ldquo;listen on repeat tracks&rdquo; this year from Oak Pantheon&rsquo;s excellent 2023 album &ldquo;The Absence&rdquo;</li>
<li>Kindred Void (and some other Koan Sound) tracks get honorable mentions</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2025/genres.jpg" alt="Chart showing Industrial, Electronic, Metalcore, Rock, and Metal genre ebbs and flows"></p>
<p>As usual, Industrial, Electronic, Metalcore, Rock, and Metal dominate my listening (with many varied subgenres therein).</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2025/fingerprint.jpg" alt="Chart showing I rate higher on consistency and variance than other listeners, but lower on replay rate, discovery rate, and concentration">
<img src="https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2025/mainstream.jpg" alt="Chart showing I&rsquo;m 42% mainstream"></p>
<p>We are not surprised my listening is not &ldquo;normal&rdquo;. I also expect this chart is not <em>my</em> normal either due to the project I mentioned at the start of this post. I&rsquo;m not sure how useful these are, especially with no definitions. I&rsquo;m sharing them anyway.</p>

<p>Stay tuned to get a copy of my &ldquo;faves&rdquo; playlist, courtesy of <a href="https://albumwhale.com">Album Whale</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>our focus has moved from outside to inside</li>
<li>faith and spirituality are one of the best predictors of happiness and emotional well-being</li>
<li>&ldquo;shape&rdquo; is referring to the curve of our attention</li>
<li>&ldquo;grace <strong>exists</strong>, and you have to turn away from yourself to find it&rdquo;</li>
<li>Cartesian doubt flipped the order of believing in facts from everything observable to the state of our own mind</li>
<li>What Descartes did for <strong>truth</strong>, Freud did for <strong>mental health</strong></li>
<li>(and it&rsquo;s hard to have a &ldquo;clear, honest&rdquo; view of ourselves)</li>
<li>&ldquo;scarcity trap&rdquo; - where dealing with one area exacerbates another</li>
<li>self-esteem can be thought of as the gap between who you are and who you want to be (success vs. pretensions)</li>
<li>(this is dangerous with our appetites &amp;  comparisons &amp; hedonic adaption, also dangerous because you &ldquo;measure&rdquo; it and it is variable)</li>
<li>you can&rsquo;t &ldquo;talk someone out of&rdquo; the cracks in the mirror that are their self-view of self-esteem</li>
<li>&ldquo;conspiracies proliferate because we prefer comforting lies over the unexplainable and mysterious&rdquo;</li>
<li>(they also create community and give us a &ldquo;heroic purpose&rdquo;)</li>
<li>&ldquo;there seems to be an asymmetry here between the magnitude of the hatred give the triviality of the subject matter&rdquo; (this happens in fan culture because we have literally bought into meaning)</li>
<li>&ldquo;nothing defines the modern self better than how we vote&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Time, now, to hold up the mirror. I have a few questions to ask you: What&rsquo;s your hero game? How are you exhausting yourself pursuing status, success, and significance? Why can&rsquo;t you rest? What bike pump of self-esteem are you working at so furiously to fill your life with purpose? Where are you seeing the devil in the face of others? What are the prejudices at the root of your easy hatreds? I know you (probably) aren&rsquo;t wearing a cape or a mask, but tell me: What&rsquo;s your superhero complex?</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;our default mental state is that our minds wander, and getting lost within ourselves makes us unhappy&rdquo;</li>
<li>D: depressive rumination</li>
<li>self-distancing technique: replace personal pronoun with your own name, helps with objectivity</li>
<li>cognitive restructuring and CBT may still be rumination because it&rsquo;s still focusing on your thoughts</li>
<li>ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) goes a step beyond CBT in distancing</li>
<li>(this gets to the observe/curious angle I&rsquo;m familiar with in various approaches, like many mindfulness practices)</li>
<li>contemplative prayer quiets the ego</li>
<li>&ldquo;humility is the foundation of happiness&rdquo;</li>
<li>(not talking about self-effacing, but less self-invested)</li>
<li>&ldquo;awe&rdquo; and &ldquo;wonder&rdquo; can pull us outside ourselves</li>
<li>&ldquo;transcendence is the key to joy&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;science knows the <strong>direction</strong> of joy and is happy to hand you a map, but science is silent on the <strong>source</strong> of joy&rdquo;</li>
<li>the &ldquo;firmness&rdquo; of material vs transcendent world has switched form how ancients experienced it</li>
<li>we experience more awe from <strong>moral</strong> beauty than from <strong>physical</strong> beauty (e.g. courage &amp; kindness over art &amp; nature)</li>
<li>relational/social &ldquo;mattering&rdquo; is important, but cosmic/existential &ldquo;mattering&rdquo; is far more important</li>
<li>(especially since relationships can let you down, especially when you need them most)</li>
<li>&ldquo;our perception is affected by what we care about&rdquo;</li>
<li>meaning is determined by <strong>coherence</strong>, <strong>purpose</strong>, and <strong>mattering</strong> and joy affects all these and gives a narrative/anchor for 1 &amp; 2</li>
<li>gratitude also faces outward and is transcendent</li>
<li>love (especially sacrificial love) must have a firm foundation in healthy ego, not doing the &ldquo;goldilocks game&rdquo;</li>
<li>if you are struggling with the ego/transcendence, find people/things to love and care for: it pulls you outside of yourself</li>
</ul>

			 <p>Read: <em><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/">The Ultimate Hidden Truth of the World…</a></em> by David Graeber (posthumously)</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong></p>
<p>This is a fine collection of Graeber&rsquo;s essays, covering a variety of periods and topics, but building a robust overview of his work.</p>
<p>Though I have read some of these essays before, the quality of Graeber&rsquo;s analysis, storytelling, and writing means that I was happy to read them again, and gained additional insights.</p>
<p>The essay &ldquo;Are You an Anarchist?&rdquo; reminds me of the &ldquo;everyday anarchism&rdquo; series I&rsquo;ve oft considered writing. E.g. &ldquo;When you do (thing), anarchism is among you.&rdquo; ( <em>Secret hint: you usually <strong>are</strong> an anarchist, or at least act like one.</em>)</p>
<p><em>Note: I do not recommend the audiobook format.</em></p>

			 <p>Read: <em><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/">Dopamine Nation</a></em> by Anna Lemke</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong></p>
<p>There was not much here that was completely new to me, but the stories were well-told, and it was a useful collection of reminders.</p>
<p>For example, I am reminded once again by the fact that having some self-directed misery in our lives helps us feel much better the rest of the time. Cold baths, ascetic practices, hard exercise, primitive camping, etc. can all help with our balance, perspective, and our physiological state of pain and pleasure.</p>
<p>And also again: leaning into survivable, copeable challenges is often the best way through, and leads to the most growth.</p>
<h1 id="my-reading-highlights-and-notes">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>
<p>From the Summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>The relentless pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain leads to pain</li>
<li>Recovery begins with abstinence</li>
<li>Abstinence resets the brain’s reward pathway, and with it our capacity to take joy in simpler pleasures</li>
<li>Self-binding creates literal and metacognitive space between desire and consumption, a modern necessity in dopamine-overloaded world</li>
<li>Medications can restore homeostasis, but consider what we lose by medicating away our pain</li>
<li>Pressing on the pain side resets our balance to the side of pleasure</li>
<li>Beware of getting addicted to pain</li>
<li>Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhances intimacy, and fosters a “plenty” mindset</li>
<li>Prosocial shame affirms that we belong to the human tribe</li>
<li>Instead of running away from the world, we can find escape by immersing ourselves in it</li>
</ol>

			 <p>Last night I enjoyed chatting with folks at the Rose-Hulman sesquicentennial celebration.</p>
<p>I met <a href="https://jimgrey.net/">Jim Grey</a> whose blogs I’ve read frequently.</p>
<p>We were talking about value in engineering etc. leadership, good judgment, and good decision-making.</p>
<p>The title of this post is a large part of my perspective. One of my goals is to always be moving myself and others:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>from knowledge worker to wisdom worker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being a <strong>wisdom worker</strong> can entail a lot of things. But for me, it’s considering things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>how easy is this choice to adopt or adapt to?</li>
<li>does this scale?</li>
<li>can we maintain this easily?</li>
<li>what are the unintended or knock-on effects?</li>
<li>what are the likely failure modes?</li>
<li>how would we tell if this was effective/successful?</li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge, information, data: they sometimes help. They can provide answers to questions.</p>
<p>Wisdom, challenges, lessons: these are what help us come up with the <strong>most important questions to consider</strong> and <strong>detect bad answers</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially in a world where people have more and more ways and places to quickly get (all-too-often <em>low quality</em>) answers, it becomes more important to be able to ask the right questions, and interrogate the results when they don’t pass the sniff test.</p>
<p>How are you moving from <em>knowledge worker</em> to <strong>wisdom worker</strong>?</p>

<p>Virtue and hope must be cultivated in advance, to undermine fear’s ability to take root.</p>

<h1 id="slow-productivity-by-cal-newport">Slow Productivity by Cal Newport</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><strong>SLOW PRODUCTIVITY</strong> A philosophy for organizing knowledge work efforts in a sustainable and meaningful manner, based on the following three principles: 1. Do fewer things. 2. Work at a natural pace. 3. Obsess over quality.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>this philosophy rejects busyness, seeing overload as an obstacle to producing results that matter, not a badge of pride. It also posits that professional efforts should unfold at a more varied and humane pace, with hard periods counterbalanced by relaxation at many different timescales, and that a focus on impressive quality, not performative activity, should underpin everything.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-foundations">Part 1 FOUNDATIONS</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-rise-and-fall-of-pseudo-productivity">1 THE RISE AND FALL OF PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY</h3>
<p>It’s hard to overemphasize how unusual it is that an economic sector as large as knowledge work lacks useful standard definitions of productivity.</p>
<p>In the absence of more sophisticated measures of effectiveness, we also gravitate away from deeper efforts toward shallower, more concrete tasks that can be more easily checked off a to-do list. Long work sessions that don’t immediately produce obvious contrails of effort become a source of anxiety—it’s safer to chime in on email threads and “jump on” calls than to put your head down and create a bold new strategy.</p>
<p><strong>PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY</strong> The use of visible activity as the primary means of approximating actual productive effort.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Many people would rather pretend to be busy in an air-conditioned office than stamp sheet metal all day on a hot factory floor.</p>
<h3 id="2-a-slower-alternative">2 A SLOWER ALTERNATIVE</h3>
<p>There’s a personal satisfaction in grimly pointing out the flaws in a system, but sustainable change, Petrini came to believe, requires providing people with an enjoyable and life-affirming alternative.</p>
<p>There’s a temptation in activism to propose radically new ideas, as this preserves the utopian possibility of a pristine solution. Petrini recognized, however, that when it came to presenting an appealing alternative to fast food, he would be wise to draw from traditional food cultures that had developed through trial-and-error experimentation over many generations.</p>
<p>Once isolated, Petrini’s two big ideas for developing reform movements—focus on alternatives to what’s wrong and draw these solutions from time-tested traditions—are obviously not restricted to food in any fundamental sense. They can apply to any setting in which a haphazard modernism is conflicting with the human experience. This claim is validated by the many new slow movements that arose in the wake of Slow Food’s original success, targeting other aspects of our culture that were suffering from an unthinking haste.</p>
<p>This sudden interest in workplace experimentation is both welcome and needed, as much about how we work in the knowledge sector today is ossified into tradition and conventions, some of which are arbitrary and some of which are borrowed from different, older types of work.</p>
<p>Moves to maintain telecommuting or reduce the workweek help blunt some of the worst side effects of pseudo-productivity but do little to address the root problem itself.</p>
<p>a more sustainable response to the burnout crisis facing knowledge work would be to offer an appealing alternative. This would require moving beyond attempts to simply constrain pseudo-productivity to instead propose a brand-new vision of what productivity can mean.</p>
<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE WORK</strong> (GENERAL DEFINITION) The economic activity in which knowledge is transformed into an artifact with market value through the application of cognitive effort.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>it’s worth noting that the general mindset and mood conveyed in these tales are also of stand-alone value. Following Petrini’s lead, I’m convinced that one of the best ways to truly introduce you to the “lost art of accomplishment without burnout” is to immerse you in the world of those who successfully built their lives around this goal.</p>
<p>I want to reassure you that slow productivity doesn’t ask that you extinguish ambition. Humans derive great satisfaction from being good at what they do and producing useful things. This philosophy can be understood as providing a more sustainable path toward these achievements.</p>
<p>Though this book is about knowledge work productivity in general, it targets in particular anyone who has a reasonable degree of autonomy in their job. This obviously includes freelancers, solopreneurs, and those who run small businesses. Pseudo-productivity’s presence in these particular settings is not due to a boss’s demands but is instead largely self-imposed, which opens up vast potential for individual experimentation. My imagined audience, however, also includes those who might work for larger employers but still enjoy significant freedom in how they go about their work.</p>
<p>This is not to say that slow productivity cannot one day reform these corners of knowledge work as well (see my discussion in the conclusion of this book about my broader vision for the future of this movement), but every revolution needs a starting point, and for something as momentous as rethinking the very notion of productivity itself, it makes sense to focus at first on those for whom self-experimentation is possible.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-principles">Part 2 PRINCIPLES</h2>
<h3 id="3-do-fewer-things">3 DO FEWER THINGS</h3>
<p>PRINCIPLE #1: DO FEWER THINGS Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most.</p>
<p>I found myself distracted by the central mystery of these events: How is it that so many knowledge workers end up with workloads calibrated to the exact edge of the overhead tax tipping point?</p>
<p>They exist at that point of maximum sustainable overhead tax that seems to represent the worst of all configurations, as it maintains the pain of having too much to do, but keeps this pain just manageable enough to avoid reform.</p>
<p>How do knowledge workers decide when to say no to the constant bombardment of incoming requests? In the modern office context, they tend to rely on stress as a default heuristic for moderation. If you turn down a Zoom meeting invitation, there’s a social-capital cost, as you’re causing some mild harm to a colleague and potentially signaling yourself to be uncooperative or a loafer. But, if you feel sufficiently stressed about your workload, this cost might become acceptable: you feel confident that you’re close to becoming unsustainably busy, and this provides psychological cover to skip the Zoom. You need to feel sufficient personal distress to justify the distress saying no might generate in the other party.</p>
<p>toiling at maximum capacity greatly reduces the rate at which we accomplish useful things, as it chokes our schedule in administrative kudzu and splinters our attention into fragments too small to support original thinking.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-limit-the-big">Proposition: Limit the Big</h4>
<p>He didn’t resolve, in some generic fashion, to try to take on less; he instead put in place specific rules (e.g., no conferences), habits (e.g., work from home as much as possible), and even ploys (e.g., trickling out his already completed research)—all directed toward minimizing the number of big items tugging at his attention.</p>
<p>Intentional limits set concurrently at all three of these scales are more likely to succeed than focusing on just one scale in isolation.</p>
<h5 id="limit-missions">LIMIT MISSIONS</h5>
<p>The term <strong>mission</strong> can sound grandiose. For our purposes, we’ll demote it to a more pragmatic definition: any ongoing goal or service that directs your professional life.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>It’s hard to specify the optimal number of missions, but generally, less is better than more. There’s a romance to focusing on a single pursuit, but this level of simplicity is typically accessible only to the most purely creative fields&hellip;.Two or three missions are more tractable and still quite minimalist.</p>
<h5 id="limit-projects">LIMIT PROJECTS</h5>
<p>Missions require that you initiate “projects,” which is my term for any work-related initiative that cannot be completed in a single session. Some projects you complete once and then are done, such as updating the sales copy on a product website. Other projects are ongoing, meaning they unfold without any clear stopping point, such as answering support queries from clients. Projects create many of the concrete tasks that take up your time during the day. It follows that limiting them is critical to limiting your overall work volume.</p>
<p>If you instead have a reputation as someone who is careful about managing their time and can quantify your busyness more concretely, you have a better chance of avoiding the new work. When you say, “I don’t see any really significant swaths of open time to work on something like this for at least three weeks, and in the meantime, I have five other projects competing for my schedule,” it’s hard for someone to rebut you, unless they’re willing to challenge your calculations, or demand that you expand your working hours to accommodate their specific request.</p>
<p>To gain this credibility, I recommend, at first, when considering a new project, you estimate how much time it will require and then go find that time and schedule it on your calendar. Block off the hours as you would for a meeting. If you’re unable to find enough blank spaces in your schedule in the near future to easily fit the work, then you don’t have enough time for it. Either decline the project, or cancel something else to make room. The power of this approach is that you’re dealing with the reality of your time, not a gut feeling about how busy you are at the moment.</p>
<p>You don’t have to continue pre-scheduling your projects in this manner indefinitely. After you’ve executed this strategy for a while, you’ll develop an instinct for roughly how many commitments you can maintain at any point without overtaxing your time. Going forward, it becomes sufficient to just track your current project tally, and reject new work once you pass your limit—making adjustments as needed, of course, for unusually busy periods.</p>
<h5 id="limit-daily-goals">LIMIT DAILY GOALS</h5>
<p>We’ve arrived at the smallest scale of work that we’ll consider for our limiting strategies: the projects you decide to make progress on during the current day. My recommendation here is simple: work on at most one project per day.</p>
<p>There’s a calibrated steadiness to working on just one major initiative a day. Real progress accrues, while anxiety is subdued.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-contain-the-small">Proposition: Contain the Small</h4>
<p>I enjoy collecting these stories of glamorous defenses against distraction. I find them aspirational, even if they remain, in their specifics, often laughably unobtainable.</p>
<p>This advice is unified by the notion of containment.</p>
<h5 id="put-tasks-on-autopilot">PUT TASKS ON AUTOPILOT</h5>
<p>In the context of knowledge work, it turns out, autopilot schedules provide an effective means to contain tasks. Instead of setting regular times each week for completing school assignments, you can set times for accomplishing specific categories of regularly occurring tasks.</p>
<p>A key refinement to support this task-centric version of autopilot scheduling is to leverage rituals and locations.</p>
<p>Containing tasks is not about escaping the small. It’s instead about making these efforts as painless as possible. Seeking, as I once put it, that “low-stress sweet spot.”</p>
<h5 id="synchronize">SYNCHRONIZE</h5>
<p>There are many explanations for Mann’s disillusionment with detailed task management systems like GTD. The one I want to highlight here is perhaps the most fundamental: they didn’t work. To be fair, they weren’t entirely ineffective. Moving obligations out of your mind and into trusted systems—the foundation of GTD—will make you less anxious and more organized.</p>
<p>transformed office collaboration into an ongoing, haphazard bazaar of asynchronous, back-and-forth messaging—a colleague asks you to handle something, you reply to clarify what he means, you then write another colleague to gather the needed information, but based on her response, you realize you don’t fully understand the task, so you send a new message to the original requester, and so on. Multiply these drawn-out interactions by dozens of concurrent open loops, and soon you’re spending most of your time managing conversations, not executing individual tasks.</p>
<p>A direct strategy for reducing collaboration overhead is to replace asynchronous communication with real-time conversations.</p>
<p>The right balance can be found in using office hours: regularly scheduled sessions for quick discussions that can be used to resolve many different issues. Set aside the same thirty to sixty minutes every afternoon, and advertise this time to your colleagues and clients.</p>
<p>If someone sends you an ambiguous message, instead of letting it instigate yet another stretched-out volley of back-and-forth missives, reply, “Happy to help! Grab me during one of my upcoming office hours and we’ll figure out the details.”</p>
<p>This approach can also be adapted for teams in the form of a related strategy that I call docket-clearing meetings. Like office hours, these meetings happen at the same times on the same days, each week. Unlike office hours, they’re attended by your entire team. During these sessions, your team churns through any pending tasks that require collaboration or clarification. The group moves through the tasks one at a time, figuring out for each what exactly needs to be done, who is working on it, and what information they need from others. An easy way to organize these sessions is to maintain a shared document of tasks to discuss. Team members can add items to the list as they come up in between meetings. One thirty-minute docket-clearing session can save a team from hours of highly distracting inbox checking and back-and-forth emailing.</p>
<p>The cure isn’t to be found in smarter task systems, but instead in a return to something simpler, and more human: regular conversation.</p>
<h5 id="make-other-people-work-more">MAKE OTHER PEOPLE WORK MORE</h5>
<p>Create a public task list for each of the major categories of tasks you tackle in your job. You can use a shared document for this purpose. (If you’re feeling more advanced, a shared Trello board is perhaps even better.) When someone asks you to take on some small obligation, direct them to add it themselves to the relevant shared task list; writing it, for example, into the shared doc, or creating a new card for it on the shared Trello board. Critically, make it clear that all of the information you’ll need to complete the task should be included in their entry.</p>
<p>Another strategy along these lines is to introduce processes that require your colleagues or clients to do more of the work associated with a given task.</p>
<p>At first, these strategies for making the burden of task assignments more symmetric can feel self-indulgent. You might even worry that others will be offended by your brashness. In reality, however, if you’re diplomatic in your phrasing, and deploy sufficient self-deprecation, you can introduce these systems without attracting too much ire. Indeed, your peers might end up appreciating the added structure, as it provides clarity about how or when their requested work will actually be accomplished.</p>
<h5 id="avoid-task-engines">AVOID TASK ENGINES</h5>
<p>When selecting new projects, assess your options by the number of weekly requests, questions, or small chores you expect the project to generate. Prioritize options that minimize this number.</p>
<h5 id="spend-money">SPEND MONEY</h5>
<p>Every effective entrepreneur I know shares a similar commitment to paying people who know what they’re doing so they don’t have to do the work, at a lower level of quality, all by themselves.</p>
<h4 id="interlude-what-about-overwhelmed-parents">Interlude: What about Overwhelmed Parents?</h4>
<h4 id="proposition-pull-instead-of-push">Proposition: Pull Instead of Push</h4>
<p>In a push-based process, each stage pushes work onward to the next as soon as it’s done. In a pull-based process, by contrast, each stage pulls in new work only when it’s ready for it.</p>
<p>Shifting to a pull-based operation made backlogs impossible: the pace of the pipeline would adapt to whatever stage was running slowest. This transparency, in turn, helped the workers identify places where the system was out of balance.</p>
<p>The key is to simulate a pull-based assignment system in such a way that the people you work with don’t even realize you’re trying something new. What follows is a three-step strategy for implementing a simulated pull system as an individual without control over the habits of your colleagues or clients.</p>
<h5 id="simulated-pull-part-1-holding-tank-and-active-lists">SIMULATED PULL, PART 1: HOLDING TANK AND ACTIVE LISTS</h5>
<p>The first step in simulating a pull-based workflow is tracking all projects to which you’re currently committed on a list divided into two sections: “holding tank” and “active.”</p>
<p>When a new project is pushed toward you, place it in the holding-pen section of your list. There is no bound to the size of your holding tank.</p>
<p>The active position of the list, by contrast, should be limited to three projects at most.</p>
<p>When scheduling your time, you should focus your attention only on the projects on your active list.</p>
<h5 id="simulated-pull-part-2-intake-procedure">SIMULATED PULL, PART 2: INTAKE PROCEDURE</h5>
<p>When adding a new project to your holding tank, it’s important to update the source of this new obligation about what they should expect. To do so, send an acknowledgment message that formally acknowledges the project that you’re committing to complete, but that also includes the following three pieces of extra information: (1) a request for any additional details you need from the source before you can start the project, (2) a count of the number of existing projects already on your lists, and (3) an estimate of when you expect to complete this new work.</p>
<p>label the project with the time estimate you included in your acknowledgment message so you won’t later forget. Notice, when making this estimate, you can look at the estimates on all of your existing projects to help inform a realistic prediction.</p>
<p>If you fall behind on a project, update your estimate and inform the person who originally sent you the work about the delay. The key here is transparency. Be clear about what’s going on, and deliver on your promises, even if these promises have to change. Never let a project just drop through the cracks and hope it will be forgotten. If your colleagues and clients don’t trust you to deliver, they won’t stop bothering you.</p>
<h5 id="simulated-pull-part-3-list-cleaning">SIMULATED PULL, PART 3: LIST CLEANING</h5>
<p>In these cases, remove the outdated projects from your lists. But before you do so, send a quick note to their original source letting them know. Simulating a pull-based workflow works only if you maintain transparency.</p>
<h3 id="4-work-at-a-natural-pace">4 WORK AT A NATURAL PACE</h3>
<p>It’s true that many of us have bosses or clients making demands, but they don’t always dictate the details of our daily schedules—it’s often our own anxieties that play the role of the fiercest taskmaster.</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE #2: WORK AT A NATURAL PACE Don’t rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance.</p>
<p>Monotonous, all-day effort is unavoidable when you’re harvesting crops or working an assembly-line station—the best you can do is mitigate its worst impacts with rituals and laws. It’s less clear that this unvarying intensity is equally as unavoidable in knowledge work.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-take-longer">Proposition: Take Longer</h4>
<h5 id="make-a-five-year-plan">MAKE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN</h5>
<h5 id="double-your-project-timelines">DOUBLE YOUR PROJECT TIMELINES</h5>
<p>take whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for upcoming projects, and then double their length.</p>
<p>A reality of personal productivity is that humans are not great at estimating the time required for cognitive endeavors. We’re wired to understand the demands of tangible efforts, like crafting a hand ax, or gathering edible plants. When it comes to planning pursuits for which we lack physical intuition, however, we’re guessing more than we realize, leading us to gravitate toward best-case scenarios for how long things might take.</p>
<p>The fear here, of course, is that by doubling these timelines, you’ll drastically reduce what you accomplish. But your original plans were never realistic or sustainable in the first place.</p>
<p>A key tenet of slow productivity is that grand achievement is built on the steady accumulation of modest results over time. This path is long. Pace yourself.</p>
<h5 id="simplify-your-workday">SIMPLIFY YOUR WORKDAY</h5>
<p>To create more reasonable workdays, I have two suggestions: first, reduce the number of tasks you schedule, and second, reduce the number of appointments on your calendar. In other words, cut back on what you plan to accomplish while increasing your available time.</p>
<p>The first suggestion is simple to implement: apply the heuristic of reducing whatever task list you come up with for a given day by somewhere between 25 and 50 percent.</p>
<p>When it comes to taming appointments, a good target is to ensure that no more than half of the hours in any single day are dedicated to meetings or calls. The simplest way to meet this mark is to declare certain hours to be protected (e.g., no meetings before noon).</p>
<p>A subtler alternative is to instead implement a “one for you, one for me” strategy. Every time you add a meeting to your calendar for a given day, find an equal amount of time that day to protect.</p>
<h5 id="forgive-yourself">FORGIVE YOURSELF</h5>
<p>It’s tempting to react to these periods of depressed productivity by assigning yourself a penance of crushing busyness. If you’re exhausted, you tell yourself, you can’t be accused of laziness.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-embrace-seasonality">Proposition: Embrace Seasonality</h4>
<p>To work without change or rest all year would have seemed unusual to most of our ancestors. Seasonality was deeply integrated into the human experience.</p>
<h5 id="schedule-slow-seasons">SCHEDULE SLOW SEASONS</h5>
<p>If we’re willing to push aside all of this digital posturing, at the core of quiet quitting is a pragmatic observation: you have more control than you think over the intensity of your workload.</p>
<p>What if, for example, you decided to quiet quit a single season each year: maybe July and August, or that distracted period between Thanksgiving and the New Year?</p>
<p>For this idea to work, you should, if possible, arrange for major projects to wrap up before your simulated offseason begins, and wait to initiate major new projects until after it ends.</p>
<p>An advanced tactic here is to take on a highly visible but low-impact project during this season that you can use to temporarily deflect new work that comes your way: “I’m happy to lead that internal review project, but I’m really focused this month on mastering this new marketing software, so let’s wait until the New Year to get started.” The key is to choose a deflection project that itself doesn’t require a lot of collaboration, meetings, or urgent messages. Solo writing or research projects work well here.</p>
<h5 id="define-a-shorter-work-year">DEFINE A SHORTER WORK YEAR</h5>
<h5 id="implement-small-seasonality">IMPLEMENT “SMALL SEASONALITY”</h5>
<p><strong>No Meeting Mondays</strong></p>
<p>You don’t need to make a public announcement about this decision. When people ask when you’re free for a meeting or a call, just stop suggesting slots on that particular day.</p>
<p>Other days, of course, could also work just as well. Perhaps keeping Fridays clear of meetings works better for the pace of your particular job, or you find more value in maintaining a clear day in the middle of the week. The key to this idea is maintaining some bastion of peace amid an otherwise cluttered calendar.</p>
<p><strong>See a Matinee Once a Month</strong></p>
<p>My suggestion is to try to put aside an afternoon to escape to the movies once per month, protecting the time on your calendar well in advance so it doesn’t get snagged by a last-minute appointment.</p>
<p>To receive the benefits of this advice, it’s not necessary that you see a film. Other activities can work as well. In my own experience, for example, I’ve also found similar benefits visiting museums and going on hikes. The key observation here is that even a modest schedule of weekday escapes can be sufficient to diminish the exhaustion of an otherwise metronome-regular routine.</p>
<p><strong>Schedule Rest Projects</strong></p>
<p>The idea is simple: after putting aside time on your calendar for a major work project, schedule in the days or weeks immediately following it time to pursue something leisurely and unrelated to your work.</p>
<p>The key is to obtain a proportional balance. Hard leads to fun. The more hardness you face, the more fun you will enjoy soon after. Even if these rest projects are relatively small compared with the work that triggers them, this back-and-forth rhythm can still induce a sustaining experience of variation.</p>
<p><strong>Work in Cycles</strong></p>
<p>Adopting some notion of cycles in your own work can be understood as a more structured implementation of both the rest project and seasonal quiet quitting strategies described above.</p>

<h4 id="proposition-work-poetically">Proposition: Work Poetically</h4>
<p>sometimes cultivating a natural pace isn’t just about the time you dedicate to a project, but also the context in which the work is completed.</p>
<h5 id="match-your-space-to-your-work">MATCH YOUR SPACE TO YOUR WORK</h5>
<p>Whenever I see a generic home office, with its white bookcases and office-supply-store wall hangings, I can’t help but think about all the ways in which its inhabitant could remake the setting into something more tailored to the work it supports.</p>
<h5 id="strange-is-better-than-stylish">STRANGE IS BETTER THAN STYLISH</h5>
<p>The problem is that the home is filled with the familiar, and the familiar snares our attention, destabilizing the subtle neuronal dance required to think clearly.</p>
<p>When we pass the laundry basket outside our home office (aka our bedroom), our brain shifts toward a household-chores context, even when we would like to maintain focus on whatever pressing work needs to get done.</p>
<p>What counted was their disconnection from the familiar.</p>
<h5 id="rituals-should-be-striking">RITUALS SHOULD BE STRIKING</h5>
<p>In this account of ancient Greek Mystery cults, we learn something important about rituals in general. Their power is found not in the specifics of their activities but in the transformative effect these activities have on the mind. The more striking and notable the behaviors, the better chance they have of inducing useful changes.</p>
<p>My advice here has two parts. First, form your own personalized rituals around the work you find most important. Second, in doing so, ensure your rituals are sufficiently striking to effectively shift your mental state into something more supportive of your goals.</p>
<h3 id="5-obsess-over-quality">5 OBSESS OVER QUALITY</h3>
<p>She adopted a motto for her intentional approach: “Hardwood grows slowly.”</p>
<p>PRINCIPLE #3: OBSESS OVER QUALITY Obsess over the quality of what you produce, even if this means missing opportunities in the short term. Leverage the value of these results to gain more and more freedom in your efforts over the long term.</p>
<p>Doing fewer things and working at a natural pace are both absolutely necessary components of this philosophy, but if those earlier principles are implemented on their own, without an accompanying obsession with quality, they might serve only to fray your relationship to work over time—casting your professional efforts as an imposition that you must tame.</p>
<p>the manager has to lead a well-functioning team.</p>
<p>quality turns out to be connected in unexpected ways to our desire to escape pseudo-productivity and embrace something slower.</p>
<p>Once you commit to doing something very well, busyness becomes intolerable. In other words, this third principle helps you stick with the first.</p>
<p>The marketplace doesn’t care about your personal interest in slowing down. If you want more control over your schedule, you need something to offer in return.</p>
<p>We’ve become so used to the idea that the only reward for getting better is moving toward higher income and increased responsibilities that we forget that the fruits of pursuing quality can also be harvested in the form of a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-improve-your-taste">Proposition: Improve Your Taste</h4>
<p>In his exposition, Glass focuses on the gap that often exists between taste and ability—especially early on in a creative career. It’s easier to learn to recognize what’s good, he notes, than to master the skills required to meet this standard. &hellip; His exhortation to those just beginning their careers is to keep putting in the work, as it’s only through this deliberate effort that the gap will close.</p>
<p>When we idolize an Ira Glass–style obsession with quality, we often overlook the importance of developing our internal filters first. It’s more exciting to focus on effort, drive, and diligence—but no amount of grinding away at your proverbial radio program or novel manuscript will lead to brilliance if you don’t yet have a good understanding of what brilliance could mean.</p>
<h5 id="become-a-cinephile">BECOME A CINEPHILE</h5>
<p>There’s nothing special about cinema in this case study. The bigger observation is that there can be utility in immersing yourself in appreciation for fields that are different from your own.</p>
<p>Understand your own field, to be sure, but also focus on what’s great about other domains. It’s here that you can find a more flexible source of inspiration, a reminder of what makes the act of creation so exciting in the first place.</p>
<h5 id="start-your-own-inklings">START YOUR OWN INKLINGS</h5>
<p>When you gather with other people who share similar professional ambitions, the collective taste of the group can be superior to that of any individual. This follows, in part, from the diversity of approaches that people take toward creation in a given field. When you combine the opinions of multiple practitioners of your craft, more possibilities and nuance emerge. There’s also a focusing effect that comes from performing for a crowd.</p>
<h5 id="buy-a-fifty-dollar-notebook">BUY A FIFTY-DOLLAR NOTEBOOK</h5>
<p>Knowing how much I had spent, I figured, would make me more careful about what I wrote on its archival-quality pages, which would force me to be more structured and careful in my thinking.</p>
<p>quality tools can increase the quality of your work</p>
<p>Part of the power of these setups is found in their complexity, which puts the user in a specialized mindset, ready to do the hard work of writing efficient programs.</p>
<h4 id="interlude-what-about-perfectionism">Interlude: What about Perfectionism?</h4>
<p>Quality matters, but if it becomes everything, you may never finish.</p>
<p>When your output is only one step among many on a collaborative path toward creative progress, the pressure to get everything just right is reduced. Your goal is instead reduced to knocking the metaphorical ball back over the net with enough force for the game to proceed. Here we find as good a general strategy for balancing obsession and perfectionism as I’ve seen: Give yourself enough time to produce something great, but not unlimited time.</p>
<h4 id="proposition-bet-on-yourself">Proposition: Bet on Yourself</h4>
<p>The goal in betting on yourself, as you’ll see, is to push yourself to a new level without accidentally also pushing yourself into an unnaturally busy workload.</p>
<h5 id="write-after-the-kids-go-to-bed">WRITE AFTER THE KIDS GO TO BED</h5>
<p>The stakes here are modest: If you fail to reach the quality level that you seek, the main consequence is that during a limited period you’ve lost time you could have dedicated to more rewarding (or restful) activities. But this cost is sufficiently annoying to motivate increased attention toward your efforts.</p>
<p>This spare time strategy, of course, is not a sustainable way to work in the long term. Sacrificing too many of your leisure hours to extra work can violate both of the first two principles of slow productivity. But when deployed in moderation, dedicated to a specific project for a temporary period, this act of giving up something meaningful in pursuit of higher quality can become an effective bet on yourself.</p>
<h5 id="reduce-your-salary">REDUCE YOUR SALARY</h5>
<p>The problem, of course, is that for every Grisham there are a dozen other aspiring writers—or entrepreneurs, or artists—who end up slinking back to their old jobs, chastened and deeper in debt than when they started.</p>
<p>Don’t haphazardly quit your job to pursue a more meaningful project. Wait instead to make a major change until you have concrete evidence that your new interest satisfies the following two properties: first, people are willing to give you money for it, and second, you can replicate the result.</p>
<p>In entrepreneurship, by contrast, this might mean that your side hustle generates a steady stream of sales. Once you’ve passed these thresholds, however, take action. This doesn’t necessarily mean quitting your current job completely. It might instead mean that you reduce your hours, or take an unpaid leave.</p>
<h5 id="announce-a-schedule">ANNOUNCE A SCHEDULE</h5>
<p>If you announce your work in advance to people you know, you’ll have created expectations. If you fail to produce something notable, you’ll pay a social cost in terms of embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this may not work the same for everyone. Know yourself. It could cause you to quit. It may depend on the type of commitment. (Investment, promise, etc.)</p>
<h5 id="attract-an-investor">ATTRACT AN INVESTOR</h5>
<p>When someone has invested in your project, you’ll experience amplified motivation to pay back their trust.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>Slowing down isn’t about protesting work. It’s instead about finding a better way to do it.</p>
<p>The philosophy I developed is meant primarily for those who engage in skilled labor with significant amounts of autonomy. This target audience covers large swaths of the knowledge sector, including most freelancers, solopreneurs, and small-business owners, as well as those in fields like academia, where great freedom is afforded in how you choose and organize your efforts. If you fall into one of these categories, and are exhausted by the chronic overload and fast pacing of pseudo-productivity, then I urge you to consider radically transforming your professional life along the three principles I proposed. Do fewer things. Work at a natural pace. Obsess over quality.</p>
<p>Slow productivity is one example of this thinking, but it shouldn’t be the only one. My long-term wish is that this movement kicks off many others, creating a marketplace of different concepts of productivity, each of which might apply to different types of workers or sensibilities.</p>
<p>Revolution requires rebellions of many different scopes, from the practical and immediate to the fiery and ideological.</p>

<h2 id="prologue">PROLOGUE</h2>
<p>When we “click” with someone, our eyes often start to dilate in tandem; our pulses match; we feel the same emotions and start to complete each other’s sentences within our heads. This is known as <strong>neural entrainment</strong>, and it feels wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>But scientists have now unraveled many of the secrets of how successful conversations happen. They’ve learned that paying attention to someone’s body, alongside their voice, helps us hear them better. They have determined that how we ask a question sometimes matters more than what we ask. We’re better off, it seems, acknowledging social differences, rather than pretending they don’t exist. Every discussion is influenced by emotions, no matter how rational the topic at hand. When starting a dialogue, it helps to think of the discussion as a negotiation where the prize is figuring out what everyone wants. And, above all, the most important goal of any conversation is to connect.</p>
<p>The first one is that many discussions are actually three different conversations. There are practical, decision-making conversations that focus on What’s This Really About? There are emotional conversations, which ask How Do We Feel? And there are social conversations that explore Who Are We? We are often moving in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds. However, if we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners, at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.</p>
<p>Our goal, for the most meaningful discussions, should be to have a “learning conversation.” Specifically, we want to learn how the people around us see the world and help them understand our perspectives in turn.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-kinds-of-conversation">THE THREE KINDS OF CONVERSATION</h2>
<h3 id="the-matching-principle">THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE</h3>
<p>Some people consistently fail to synchronize with others, even when they’re speaking to close friends. Others—let’s call them <strong>supercommunicators</strong>—seem to synchronize effortlessly with just about anyone. Most of us lie somewhere in between.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Sometimes this connection occurs with just one other person. Other times, it happens within a group, or a large audience. But whenever it happens, our brains and bodies become alike because we are, in the language of neuroscientists, <strong>neurally entrained</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Scientists like Sievers don’t call these people supercommunicators—they prefer terms like high centrality participant or core information provider—but</p>
<p>These people tended to speak less than dominant leaders, and when they did open their mouths, it was usually to ask questions. They repeated others’ ideas and were quick to admit their own confusion or make fun of themselves. They encouraged their groupmates (“That’s really smart! Tell me more about what you think!”) and laughed at others’ jokes. They didn’t stand out as particularly talkative or clever, but when they spoke, everyone listened closely. And, somehow, they made it easier for other people to speak up. They made conversations flow. Sievers began referring to these people as <strong>high centrality participants</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>But the most important difference between high centrality participants and everyone else was that the high centrality participants were constantly adjusting how they communicated, in order to match their companions.</p>
<p>to become a supercommunicator, all we need to do is listen closely to what’s said and unsaid, ask the right questions, recognize and match others’ moods, and make our own feelings easy for others to perceive.</p>
<p>The first mindset—the <strong>decision-making mindset</strong>—is associated with the What’s This Really About? conversation, and it’s active whenever we’re thinking about practical matters, such as making choices or analyzing plans.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>The second mindset—the <strong>emotional mindset</strong>—emerges when we discuss How Do We Feel? and draws on neural structures—the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, among others—that help shape our beliefs, emotions, and memories.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>The third conversational mindset—the <strong>social mindset</strong>—emerges when we discuss our relationships, how we are seen by others and see ourselves, and our social identities. These are Who Are We? discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Each of these conversations—and each mindset—is, of course, deeply intertwined. We often use all three during a single dialogue. The important thing to understand is that these mindsets can shift as a conversation unfolds.</p>
<p>Miscommunication occurs when people are having different kinds of conversations. If you are speaking emotionally, while I’m talking practically, we are, in essence, using different cognitive languages.</p>
<p>The importance of this insight—that communication comes from connection and alignment—is so fundamental that it has become known as the <strong>matching principle</strong>: Effective communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is occurring, and then matching each other.</p>

<h3 id="every-conversation-is-a-negotiation">EVERY CONVERSATION IS A NEGOTIATION</h3>
<p>Some researchers call this process a <strong>quiet negotiation</strong>: A subtle give-and-take over which topics we’ll dive into and which we’ll skirt around; the rules for how we’ll speak and listen.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>“When it happens again and again, you start to realize: This isn’t a problem with my patients,” Ehdaie told me. “This is a problem with me. I’m doing something wrong. I’m failing at this conversation.”</p>
<p>The simplest method for uncovering everyone’s desires, of course, is simply asking What do you want? But that approach can fail if people don’t know, or are embarrassed to say, or aren’t certain how to express their desires, or worry that revealing too much will put them at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>“It’s important to ask what they want,” Ehdaie told me. “It’s an invitation for people to tell you who they are.”</p>
<p>Fisher and his colleagues wrote, might seem impossible, but “it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.” Since Getting to Yes was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea. Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before. Negotiation, among its top practitioners, isn’t a battle. It’s an act of creativity. This approach has become known as <strong>interest-based bargaining</strong>,</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>How will we make decisions together? What are the rules for this dialogue? Frequently, the best way to figure out those rules is by testing out various conversational approaches, and seeing how others react.</p>
<p>When we make a joke, or ask a probing question, or suddenly get serious or silly, we are, in a sense, conducting a test to see if our companions will accept our invitation, if they’ll play along.</p>
<p>These discussions call for analysis and clearheaded reasoning. Psychologists refer to this kind of thinking as <strong>the logic of costs and benefits</strong>. When people embrace logical reasoning and practical calculations—when they agree that rational decision making is the most persuasive method for making a choice together—they’re agreeing to contrast potential costs with hoped-for benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>In general, in these kinds of discussions, we make decisions not by analyzing costs and benefits, but instead by looking to our past experiences and asking ourselves, “What does someone like me usually do in a situation like this?” We are applying what psychologists call <strong>the logic of similarities</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>matching is understanding someone’s mindset—what kind of logic they find persuasive, what tone and approach makes sense to them—and then speaking their language.</p>
<h3 id="a-guide-to-using-these-ideas-part-ii">A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART II</h3>
<p>When someone makes noises as they listen (“Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” “Interesting”), it’s a sign they’re engaged, what linguists call <strong>backchanneling</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>in the moments before a conversation starts, it’s useful to describe for yourself: What are two topics you might discuss? (Being general is okay: Last night’s game and TV shows you like) What is one thing you hope to say? What is one question you will ask?</p>
<p>Once this exercise becomes second nature—and it quickly will—you can make your preparation even more robust: What are two topics you most want to discuss? What is one thing you hope to say that shows what you want to talk about? What is one question you will ask that reveals what others want?</p>
<p>Sometimes, we want others to go first. The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions, just as Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients. And open-ended questions are easy to find, if you focus on: Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”) Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”) Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”)</p>
<p>Do your companions lean toward you, make eye contact, smile, backchannel (“Interesting,” “Hmm”), or interrupt? Those are signals they want to accept your invitation. (Interruptions, contrary to expectations, usually mean people want to add something.)</p>
<p>Do they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own? People often misperceive these responses as listening. But they usually aren’t. (In fact, as the next few chapters explain, listening is much more active.) These are signals that someone is declining our invitation and wants to talk about something else—in which case, you need to keep searching—and experimenting—to learn what everyone wants.</p>
<h2 id="the-how-do-we-feel-conversation-an-overview">THE HOW DO WE FEEL? CONVERSATION AN OVERVIEW</h2>
<h3 id="the-listening-cure">THE LISTENING CURE</h3>
<p>instead of perspective taking, we ought to be focused on perspective getting, on asking people to describe their inner lives, their values and beliefs and feelings, the things they care about most.</p>
<p>In fact, there was only one method the Arons tested that could reliably help strangers form a connection: A series of thirty-six questions that, as Elaine and Arthur Aron later wrote, elicited “sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.” These questions eventually became known as the Fast Friends Procedure, and grew famous among sociologists, psychologists, and readers of articles with headlines such as “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love.”[*1]</p>
<p>To the Arons, the idea that vulnerability was important made perfect sense, in part because it lined up with a well-documented psychological phenomenon known as “<strong>emotional contagion</strong>.” In the early 1990s, a series of experiments had shown that humans typically “synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them.” This synchronization is sometimes deliberate, like when we choose to empathize with another person; more often it is automatic, happening outside of our consciousness, causing us to tear up or get angry or proud on someone else’s behalf, whether we want to or not.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>emotional contagion must be triggered by something, and one of the most reliable triggers is vulnerability. We become more prone to emotional contagion when we hear someone else express—or when we reveal our own—deeply held beliefs and values, or when we describe past experiences that were meaningful to us, or when we expose something else that opens us to others’ judgments. These are the same factors the Arons used to distinguish deep questions from shallow ones.</p>
<p>we become more susceptible to emotional contagion, and more emotionally contagious ourselves, when we share something that feels raw, something that another person might judge.</p>
<p>If you want to connect with someone, ask them what they are feeling, and then reveal your own emotions.</p>
<p>They found that during successful conversations, people tended to ask each other the kinds of questions that drew out replies where people expressed their “needs, goals, beliefs [and] emotions,” as the researchers later wrote. In unsuccessful conversations, people talked mostly about themselves, or they asked shallow questions, the kinds of inquiries that didn’t reveal anything about how their partners felt.</p>
<p>Questions about facts (“Where do you live?” “What college did you attend?”) are often conversational dead-ends. They don’t draw out values or experiences. They don’t invite vulnerability. However, those same inquiries, recast slightly (“What do you like about where you live?” “What was your favorite part of college?”), invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change. Those questions make emotional replies easier, and they practically beg the questioner to reciprocate—to divulge, in return, why they live in this neighborhood, what they enjoyed about college—until everyone is drawn in, asking and answering back and forth.</p>
<p>What’s more, these kinds of deeper questions can help fight the unfair discrepancies in how men and women, as well as other groups, are allowed to express emotions. In part, these kinds of questions succeed because they allow vulnerable replies without mandating them. They don’t seem pushy or out of place within, say, an office. But they undermine double standards by nudging people to think a bit more about how to respond.</p>
<p>This is how to ask emotional questions in the real world: Ask someone how they feel about something, and then follow up with questions that reveal how you feel.</p>
<p>deep, vulnerable questions were easier to ask—and more enjoyable to answer—than most people realized.</p>
<p>Science has provided guidance: Ask others about their beliefs and values. Ask them about experiences and those moments that caused them to change. Ask how they feel, rather than about facts. Reframe your questions so they are deeper. Ask follow-ups. And as people expose their vulnerabilities, reveal something about yourself. It will be less uncomfortable than you imagine. It will be more fascinating than you think. And it might lead to a moment of true connection.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-you-hear-emotions-no-one-says-aloud">HOW DO YOU HEAR EMOTIONS NO ONE SAYS ALOUD?</h3>
<p>Psychologists refer to this kind of communication as <strong>nonlinguistic emotional expressions</strong>, and they comprise a vast portion of how we convey our feelings in everyday life.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>We laugh, in other words, to show someone that we want to connect with them—and our companions laugh back to demonstrate they want to connect with us, as well. This is the same kind of reciprocity that powers the Fast Friends Procedure. It’s an example of emotional contagion.</p>
<p>Laughter, and other nonlinguistic expressions such as gasps and sighs, or smiles and frowns, are embodiments of the <strong>matching principle</strong>, which says that we communicate by aligning our behaviors until our brains become entrained.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>When we laugh together, it’s not just the laughter that’s important. It’s similar intensities—the evidence of a desire to connect—that is critical.</p>
<p>What matters isn’t speaking and acting alike, but rather matching one another in ways that convey the desire to align.</p>
<p>In one study published in 2016, participants who listened to one-second recordings of people laughing could accurately distinguish between friends laughing together, and strangers trying to laugh alike. Laughter, like many nonlinguistic expressions, is useful because it’s hard to fake. When someone isn’t genuinely laughing, we can tell. The participants listening to the recordings in that study, based on just one second of decontextualized sound, could tell when people felt aligned and when they were likely forcing it. A joke might not be funny, but if we both agree to laugh in similar ways, we’re signaling to each other that we want to connect.</p>
<p>Even if we genuinely want to know and match someone’s emotions, that’s hard to do, because we don’t know precisely what they are feeling. So, instead, our brains have evolved this quick-acting system to examine mood and energy, which provides a general sense, in a split second, of someone’s emotional state. That’s usually enough to figure out how to align, and whether we should feel safe or alarmed.</p>
<p>We exhibit emotional intelligence by showing people that we’ve heard their emotions—and the way we do that is by noticing, and then matching, their mood and energy.</p>
<p>What mattered most, though, was whether they paid attention to McGuire’s emotional displays and then matched his energy and mood. For some candidates, matching seemed like an instinct; for others, a learned skill. And for some, it didn’t happen at all.</p>
<p>It’s hard to tell exactly what someone is feeling, to know if they are angry or upset or frustrated or annoyed or some combination of all those emotions. The person, themself, might not know. So instead of trying to decipher specific emotions, pay attention to someone’s mood (Do they seem negative or positive?) and their energy level (Are they high energy or low energy?). Then, focus on matching those two attributes—or, if matching will only exacerbate tensions, show that you hear their emotions by acknowledging how they feel. Make it obvious you are working to understand their emotions. And when you, yourself, are expressing your own emotions, notice how others are responding. Are they trying to align with your energy and mood?</p>
<h3 id="connecting-amid-conflict">CONNECTING AMID CONFLICT</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence comes from showing someone we have heard their emotions. But when we’re in a conflict or a fight, simply showing often isn’t enough. In those moments, everyone is skeptical and untrusting: Are they listening, or just preparing their rebuttal? Something more is needed, an extra step. To convince others we are genuinely listening during an argument, we must prove to them that we have heard them, prove we are working hard to understand, prove we want to see things from their perspective.</p>
<p>most people don’t know how to prove they’re listening. They try things like making eye contact with the speaker, or nodding their head to show agreement, and hope the speaker will pay attention. But speakers usually don’t.</p>
<p>When we’re speaking, we’re frequently so focused on what we are saying that we don’t pick up on how our listeners are behaving. We miss the signals that listeners are trying to send to show they are following along. So if a listener wants to prove they’re listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we’re paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said. And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.</p>
<p>Among happy couples, however, the desire for control emerged quite differently. Rather than trying to control the other person, happy couples tended to focus, instead, on controlling themselves, their environment, and the conflict itself.</p>
<p>Happy couples also focused on controlling their environment. Rather than starting a fight at the moment a conflict arose, they would put off a tough discussion until they were in a safer setting.</p>
<p>Finally, happy couples seemed to concentrate more on controlling the boundaries of the conflict itself.</p>
<p>unhappy couples let one area of disagreement spill into everything else. “They start arguing about, ‘Are we spending the holidays with my family or yours?’ and pretty soon it becomes, ‘You’re so selfish, you never do the laundry, this is why we don’t have enough money.’ ” (In marriage therapy, this is called <strong>kitchen-sinking</strong>, a particularly destructive pattern.)</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>One advantage of focusing on these three things—controlling oneself, the environment, and the boundaries of the conflict—is that it allowed happy spouses to find things they could control together. They were still fighting. They still disagreed. But, when it came to control, they were on the same side of the table.</p>
<p>If we focus on controlling ourselves, our environment, and the conflict itself, then a fight often morphs into a conversation, where the goal is understanding, rather than winning points or wounding our foes.</p>
<p>Trying to force someone to listen, or see our side, only inflames the battle. Instead, it is far better to harness our craving for control so that we’re working together, cooperating to find ways to lower the temperature and make this fight smaller.</p>
<p>This explains why looping for understanding is so powerful: When you prove to someone you are listening, you are, in effect, giving them some control over the conversation. This is also why the matching principle is so effective: When we follow someone else’s lead and become emotional when they are emotional, or practical when they have signaled a practical mindset, we are sharing control over how a dialogue flows.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when we try to exert control, we don’t realize we’re doing it. We think we’re simply stating our opinion, or offering advice, and don’t understand that others will perceive it as attempting to strong-arm a conversation’s direction.</p>
<h3 id="a-guide-to-using-these-ideas-part-iii">A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART III</h3>
<p>There is a moment, in many conversations, when someone says something emotional, or we reveal our own feelings, or we want to understand why we keep fighting, or we hope to get closer to someone who feels distant. That is when a How Do We Feel? conversation might begin, if we allow it to. And one of the best ways to start is to ask a deep question. Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned.</p>
<p>A deep question asks about someone’s values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts.</p>
<p>A deep question asks people to talk about how they feel.</p>
<p>Asking a deep question should feel like sharing.</p>
<p>Once we ask a deep question, we need to listen closely to how others reply. Listening requires paying attention to more than just the words they say. To hear what a person is saying, we also need to pay attention to their nonlinguistic emotional expressions—the sounds they make, their gestures, tone of voice and cadence, how they hold their bodies and their expressions.</p>
<p>it is critical to be attuned to two things:</p>
<p>Mood: Do they seem upbeat or glum? How would you describe their expressions? Are they laughing, or shouting? Are they up or down?</p>
<p>Energy: Are they high energy, or low energy? Quiet and withdrawn or talkative and expressive? If they seem happy, is it calm and content (low energy) or excited and outgoing (high energy)? If they are unhappy, are they sad (low energy) or agitated (high energy)?</p>
<p>Mood and energy levels often tell us all we need to know in order to align emotionally. Sometimes, we might not want to match emotions: If someone is angry, and we become angry, it may drive us apart. But if we acknowledge their mood and energy—“You seem upset. What’s wrong?”—we can start to align.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of emotional communication is showing others we hear their emotions, which helps us reciprocate. There’s a technique for this—looping for understanding. Here’s how it works: Ask questions, to make sure you understand what someone has said. Repeat back, in your own words, what you heard. Ask if you got it right. Continue until everyone agrees we understand.</p>
<p>The goal of looping isn’t parroting someone’s words, but rather distilling another person’s thoughts in your own language, showing them that you are working hard to see their perspective, and then repeating the process until everyone is aligned.</p>
<p>We reciprocate vulnerability by… Looping for understanding, until you understand what someone is feeling. Looking for what someone needs: Do they want comfort? Empathy? Advice? Tough love? (If you don’t know the answer, loop more.) Asking permission. “Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?” or “Would you mind if I shared something from my own life?” or “Can I share how I’ve seen others handle this?” Giving something in return. This can be as simple as describing how you feel: “It makes me sad to hear you’re in pain,” or “I’m so happy for you,” or “I’m proud to be your friend.”</p>
<p>When we are in conflict with someone… First, acknowledge understanding. We do this through looping and statements such as “Let me make sure I understand.” &hellip; Second, find specific points of agreement. Look for places where you can say “I agree with you” or “I think you’re right that…” These remind everyone that, though we may have differences, we want to be aligned. Finally, temper your claims. Don’t make sweeping statements such as “Everyone knows that’s not true” or “Your side always gets this wrong.” Rather, use words like somewhat or “It might be…” and speak about specific experiences (“I want to talk about why you left dishes in the sink last night”) rather than broad generalities (“I want to talk about how you never do your part around the house”).</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems with online discussions, of course, is they lack the information usually provided by our voices and bodies: Our vocal tones, gestures, expressions, and the cadence and energy we bring to our speech. Even when we write letters, we tend to include nuances and subtleties that come from editing ourselves and thinking about what we want to say.</p>
<p>When talking online, remember to… Overemphasize politeness. Numerous studies have shown that online tensions are lessened if at least one person is consistently polite. In one study, all it took was adding thanks and please to a series of online arguments—while everything else stayed the same—to reduce tensions. &hellip; Underemphasize sarcasm. When we say something in a wry tone, it signals an irony our audience usually understands. When we type something sarcastic online, we typically hear these same inflections within our heads—but the people reading our comments do not. Express more gratitude, deference, greetings, apologies, and hedges. Studies demonstrate that when we are grateful (“That comment taught me a lot”), or solicitous (“I would love to hear your thoughts”), or preface comments with a greeting (“Hey!”), or apologize in advance (“I hope you don’t mind…”) or hedge our comments (“I think…”), online communication gets better. Avoid criticism in public forums. In another study, researchers found that giving negative feedback online backfires much more than in real life. It pushes people to write more negative things, and to start criticizing others more frequently. When we criticize others publicly online, we make bad behavior into a digital norm.</p>
<h2 id="the-who-are-we-conversation">THE WHO ARE WE? CONVERSATION</h2>
<h3 id="our-social-identities-shape-our-worlds">OUR SOCIAL IDENTITIES SHAPE OUR WORLDS</h3>
<p>“<strong>social identities</strong>”: The self-images we all form based on the groups we belong to, the people we befriend, the organizations we join, and the histories we embrace or shun.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>The meaningfulness of various identities—the importance of gender versus race versus politics versus who we support in the Super Bowl—becomes more and less salient based on our environment and what’s happening around us.</p>
<p>Steele and his colleagues called this undermining effect <strong>stereotype threat</strong>, and since those first experiments in the late 1990s, hundreds of other studies have both confirmed its existence and examined its pernicious effect. Simply knowing that a stereotype exists can influence how we behave.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Put differently, when researchers changed the environment, it made stereotypes less salient and therefore less threatening. “You can do that in a classroom, which is good,” Steele told me. “But it’s hard to do that in society, where everyone knows these stereotypes exist.”</p>
<p>It’s crucial, in a Who Are We? conversation, to remind ourselves that we all possess multiple identities:</p>
<p>“When my son goes to school, I tell him, remember, that test may be hard today, but think about who else you are,” said Gresky, the researcher at Texas Christian University. “We can make the bad voices in our head less powerful by remembering all the other voices in there, too.”</p>
<p>The process for drawing out those voices is relatively straightforward: In a Who Are We? conversation, invite people to talk about their backgrounds, allegiances, how their communities have shaped them. (“Where are you from? Oh, really? What was it like growing up there?”) Then, reciprocate by describing how you see yourself. (“You know, as a southerner, I think that…”) Finally, avoid the trap of one-dimensionality by evoking all the many identities we all possess as a conversation unfolds: “I hear you saying that, as a lawyer, you support the police, but as a parent, do you worry about cops pulling over your kid?”</p>
<p>the <strong>contact hypothesis</strong>—the theory that, if you bring people with clashing social identities together under specific conditions, you can overcome old hatreds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>These kinds of environmental shifts point to what is needed for a successful Who Are We? conversation: First, try to draw out your conversational partners’ multiple identities. It’s important to remind everyone that we all contain multitudes; none of us is one-dimensional. Acknowledging those complexities during a conversation helps disrupt the stereotypes within our heads. Second, try to ensure everyone is on equal footing. Don’t offer unsolicited advice or trumpet your wealth or connections. Seek out topics where everyone has some experience and knowledge, or everyone is a novice. Encourage the quiet to speak and the talkative to listen, so everyone is participating. Finally, look for social similarities that already exist. We do this naturally when we meet someone new and start searching for people we know in common. But it is important to take those connections a step further and make our commonalities more salient.</p>
<p>the most effective approach was something known as <strong>motivational interviewing</strong>, a method originally developed in the 1980s to help problem drinkers. In motivational interviewing, a 2012 paper explains, “counselors rarely attempt to convince or persuade. Instead, the counselor subtly guides the client to think about and verbally express their own reasons for and against change.” Motivational interviewing seeks to draw out a person’s beliefs, values, and social identities, in the hopes that, once all these complexities and complicated beliefs are on the table, unexpected opportunities for change might appear.</p>

<h3 id="how-do-we-make-the-hardest-conversations-safer">HOW DO WE MAKE THE HARDEST CONVERSATIONS SAFER?</h3>
<p>the listener, offended, would become defensive as their sense of self—their identity—was attacked. In psychology, this is known as <strong>identity threat</strong>, and it is deeply corrosive to communication.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>The mere possibility of identity threat frequently stops people from talking about Who Are We?</p>
<p>There are lessons here for tough conversations of all types, even beyond those related to our identities. The first insight is that, as we’ve seen before, preparing for a conversation before it begins—thinking just a little bit more when we open our mouths—can have enormous impacts. Anticipating obstacles, planning for what to do when they arise, considering what you hope to say, thinking about what might be important to others: Before any challenging conversation, think for a few moments about what you hope will happen, what might go wrong, and how you’ll react when it does. The second lesson is that just because we’re worried about a conversation, that doesn’t mean we ought to avoid it. When we need to deliver disappointing news to a friend, complain to a boss, or discuss something unpleasant with our partner, it’s normal to feel a sense of hesitation. But we can reduce that tension by reminding ourselves why this conversation is important and diminish our anxieties by acknowledging, to ourselves and others, that these conversations may be awkward at first, but will get easier. Third, thinking about how a conversation will occur is just as important as what is said, particularly during a Who Are We? conversation. Who will speak first? (Studies suggest the person with the least power should begin.) What kinds of emotions should we anticipate? (If we prepare for discomfort and tension, we make them easier to withstand.) What obstacles should we expect? When they emerge, what will we do? Most important, what benefits do we expect will emerge from this dialogue, and are they worth the risks?</p>
<p>Establish guidelines and make sure they are clearly communicated. Invite everyone into the dialogue and give everyone a voice—and let everyone know they are expected to examine themselves. Focus on belonging, and creating a sense that everyone is welcome.</p>
<p>as Kiara Sanchez put it, the aim is not to “neutralize the discomfort, but rather give people a framework for persevering through it. It seems like a minor distinction, but the underlying theory is that discomfort can be helpful.” Discomfort pushes us to think before we speak, to try to understand how others see or hear things differently. Discomfort reminds us to keep going, that the goal is worth the challenge.</p>
<p>It is important to note that, alongside encouraging such questions, guidelines must also allow people to decline to answer. This is critical because, historically, individuals from marginalized communities have been asked to do an outsized amount of work describing their lives.</p>
<h3 id="a-guide-to-using-these-ideas-part-iv">A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART IV</h3>
<p>consider our actions during three distinct periods: before a discussion, at the beginning of the discussion, and as the discussion unfolds.</p>
<p>Ask yourself: What do you hope to accomplish? &hellip; How will this conversation start? &hellip; What obstacles might emerge? &hellip; When those obstacles appear, what’s the plan? &hellip; Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue?</p>
<p>As a conversation begins: First, establish guidelines. &hellip; Second, draw out everyone’s goals. &hellip; Finally, acknowledge, and keep acknowledging, that discomfort is natural—and useful.</p>
<p>Once we’ve prepared for a hard conversation, and have discussed guidelines and goals, we should remember to: Draw out multiple identities. &hellip; Work to ensure everyone is on an equal footing. &hellip; Acknowledge people’s experiences and look for genuine similarities. &hellip; Manage your environment.</p>
<h2 id="afterword">AFTERWORD</h2>
<p>They discovered some correlations: Having loving parents made it easier to find happiness as an adult. Possessing genes related to physical hardiness and longevity was helpful—as was getting enough exercise and eating well. Education early in life, as well as a lifelong commitment to learning, also provided a leg up. However, as important as these factors were, one thing seemed to matter much more than anything else. It didn’t come as a surprise; it had been obvious to everyone, across the decades, as they had conducted their interviews. The most important variable in determining whether someone ended up happy and healthy, or miserable and sick, was “how satisfied they were in their relationships,” one researcher wrote. “The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest (mentally and physically) at age 80.”</p>
<p>Across the decades and surveys, similar findings emerged again and again: The happiest participants called others regularly, made lunch and dinner dates, sent notes to friends saying they were proud of them, or wanted to help them shoulder sad news. Most of all, happy participants engaged in many, many conversations over the years that brought them closer to others.</p>
<p>This central finding has been replicated in hundreds of other studies over the past few decades. “We now have robust evidence indicating that being socially connected has a powerful influence on longevity, such that having more and better relationships is associated with protection and, conversely, that having fewer and poorer relationships is associated with risk,”</p>
<p>It has helped me to connect better, to be more mindful when other people reveal something personal, to know that there is always a conversation going on—be it practical, emotional, or social—and that we won’t be able to connect until we come to an understanding about what we all want and need. Most of all, it has convinced me of the importance of having learning conversations, where my aim is to pay attention to what kind of conversation is occurring; to identify our goals for a dialogue; to ask about others’ emotions and share my own feelings; and to explore if our identities influence what we say and hear.</p>
<p>There is no single right way to connect with other people. There are skills that make conversations easier and less awkward. There are tips that increase the odds you’ll understand your companions, and they’ll be more likely to hear what you are trying to say. The effectiveness of various conversational tactics waxes and wanes based on our surroundings, the types of discussion we’re having, the kind of relationships we hope to achieve. Sometimes we get there; sometimes we don’t. But what’s important is wanting to connect, wanting to understand someone, wanting to have a deep conversation, even when it is hard and scary, or when it would be so much easier to walk away. There are skills and insights that can help us satisfy that desire for connection, and they are worth learning, practicing, and committing to. Because whether we call it love, or friendship, or simply having a great conversation, achieving connection—authentic, meaningful connection—is the most important thing in life.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://incendiary.bandcamp.com/">Incendiary</a> - solid, though a little simple and went too hard into southern rock for my taste. Liked that the singer was positive and cool about helping each other out in the pit.</li>
<li>The Showdown - the singer did the thing where they were very demanding (almost upset?) about what the crowd does. I really dislike this from bands. If you feel like you have to be really pushy with your fans to get more energetic (or whatever) maybe the problem is your music or performance, not them. Do better.</li>
<li><a href="https://eighteenvisions.bandcamp.com/">Eighteen Visions</a> - not really my thing, but a good show.</li>
<li><a href="https://boysnightout.bandcamp.com/">Boys Night Out</a> - ok. Said this was their first show in 15 years, and singer had good stage chatter. Unfortunately, they cut into Extol’s time.</li>
<li><a href="https://extol.bandcamp.com/">Extol</a> feat. Bruce Fitzhugh - once-in-a-lifetime thing. Bruce talked about how both bands (Extol and Living Sacrifice) had influenced each other. David Husvik (drums) talked about their 98 release of Burial and Cornerstone festival. Mentioned many of those bands were playing tonight (Norma Jean, Blindside, Underoath). This might be a little anachronistic, as even though that was the right era, I’m not sure all of them played that year (and Norma Jean was still Luti-Kriss). Ole Børud’s American English accent is probably better than mine, and I’m native. Bruce had to use notes, but can you blame him? He just subbed in to sing and did a great job with it, all things considered.

<li><a href="https://normajean.bandcamp.com/">Norma Jean</a> - they still got it! Josh Scogin joined for the last song and the place erupted. I’ll add links to my other posts about this.</li>
<li>Blindside - did a great job for not being a “tour band”</li>
<li><a href="https://underoath.bandcamp.com/">Underoath</a> - great show, mostly tracks from 20th anniversary, but played a few others at the end. Spencer “leaked” that another album is ready and coming out soon. (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2024/10/06/underoath-is-about.html">more</a>)</li>

			 <p><em>Disclaimers:</em> I admit I don&rsquo;t have the right words for this. Probably Matthew B. Crawford does. This is not supposed to be a &ldquo;get off my lawn&rdquo; post, but more about the nature of things.</p>
<p>I drove a rental vehicle last night.</p>
<p>It was an alienating experience.</p>
<p>The wheel turned at the slightest touch.</p>
<p>There were multiple lit screens and multiple audible alerts, constantly asking for attention. Following distance update. Lane update. Turn update. Engine update. The volume and timing of beeps was like being in a hospital emergency area. The screen reflections on other windows made it look like something was on the periphery, as well.</p>
<p>Alerts were also opinionated in unnecessary ways that don&rsquo;t always hold true. Turning on a turn signal to <strong>signal intent</strong> resulted in hyper-flashing if somebody was in the lane. Crossing the center line on a what-could-otherwise-be-a-fun-and-efficient-curve-of-the-road when nobody is around resulted in warnings.</p>
<p>My overall sense of the drive was that I was missing the <em>actual signals</em> of driving because the design favored <em>secondary signals</em> over the more-direct ones. I can&rsquo;t see how this doesn&rsquo;t <em>add</em> to the problem of distracted driving instead of ameliorating it.</p>
<p>Granted, we usually keep our cars 10+ years, but it was shocking to me how poorly these systems are designed for actual humans. The only good thing I could say is some of the buttons were still at least tactile instead of touch screens.</p>
<p>Are most new cars like this?</p>

			 <p>🎶 Underoath is about to close it out.</p>
<p>I haven’t seen them since Dallas Taylor and Octavio Fernandez were in the band. Those first three albums are still my faves, but they’ve had some good stuff here and there since then. #FF24</p>
<p>I think they plan to do mostly (only?) <em>Chasing Safety</em> stuff tonight.</p>

			 <p>Shorter day for me, because I was dealing with a lot of stuff and there was only one &ldquo;must see&rdquo; band for me.</p>
<p>Some of these notes are&hellip;not positive. But I&rsquo;m writing them for my memory and not trying to yuck anyone&rsquo;s yum.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://skycamefallingofficial.bandcamp.com/">Skycamefalling</a> - yes. Great show and great energy.</li>
<li><a href="https://miserysignals.bandcamp.com/">Misery Signals</a> - very interesting. Huge turnout and most intense crowd and divers. Swapped singers a couple times and both of them closed out the last song. Sounds like this was their planned final show in the USA.</li>
<li><a href="https://hailthesun.bandcamp.com/">Hail the Sun</a> - I noped right out of there. Sounded like whineycore.</li>
<li><a href="https://shaihulud.bandcamp.com/">Shai Hulud</a> - instense, good energy, good show</li>
<li><a href="https://lsdunes.bandcamp.com/">L.S. Dunes</a> - Singer didn&rsquo;t seem to know where the notes were and sounded like a worse Spencer Chamberlain</li>
<li><a href="https://victoryrecords.bandcamp.com/album/bright-flashes">Snapcase</a> - rad show and the singer was really talking about how we&rsquo;re all older now and just do what we can dancing or singing-wise. He dedicated a song to parents. :)</li>
<li><a href="https://victoryrecords.bandcamp.com/album/flesh-and-blood">No Innocent Victim</a> - wow, they still did it. For the final song, he called folks to pile up with him for <a href="https://victoryrecords.bandcamp.com/track/my-beliefs?action=download">My Beliefs</a> and there was<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DA4vlx4PnMI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"> a mound multiple-people-deep all shouting into the microphone</a>. Epic. &ldquo;I would die tonight for my beliefs!&rdquo; (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2024/10/05/or-so-years.html">more</a>)</li>
</ul>

			 <p>&hellip;back to my hotel form Furnace Fest day two.</p>
<p>I was e-biking back and was wearing my <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/09/23/like-mileszsrubysocial-i.html">With Blood Comes Cleansing T-Shirt</a> and a helmet. (As you do!)</p>
<p>A jeep pulled up beside me jam-packed with folks who were having a good time.</p>
<p>They were rocking out to August Burns Red&rsquo;s &ldquo;White Washed&rdquo; and looking over at me&hellip;kinda giving me that look to see if I was one of them.</p>
<p>So as <a href="https://youtu.be/qczeZ5Ns2Bk?t=203">this part of the song hit</a> I started shouting it out and headbanged. They shouted for joy and joined me.</p>
<p>Great times!</p>

<li>Bury Your Dead - same</li>

<li>The Devil Wears Prada - also more enjoyable in person than on-album, but felt like they were trying too hard</li>
<li><a href="https://banehc.bandcamp.com/">Bane</a> - tried it, but I think I&rsquo;m not the target market (I usually like my hardcore with a little something more going on)</li>

			 <p>🔒 The opportunity: application threat modeling &amp; secure design review is one of the highest value appsec/prodsec activities, but is hard to implement efficiently and at scale.</p>
<p>A bad solution: provide a long list of controls that need to be checked each time</p>
<p>A better solution: generate relevant security requirements automatically based on what’s being built</p>
<p>Met with <a href="https://www.primesec.ai">primesec</a> yesterday, and this is what they are trying to do! They are using LLM to read what’s in your user stories (etc.), summarizing the work for the security team, and injecting specific security control requirements.</p>
<p>If this catches even a small portion of the real requirements, it would be a major uplift for teams both from a security and efficiency perspective. Looking forward to checking it out.</p>

			 <p>Read: <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt</p>
<p><strong>Recommended</strong></p>
<h1 id="my-reading-highlights-and-notes">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>
<h2 id="introduction-the-search-for-wisdom">INTRODUCTION The Search for Wisdom</h2>
<p>This is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread widely in recent years: The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.</p>
<p>While many propositions are untrue, in order to be classified as a Great Untruth, an idea must meet three criteria: It contradicts ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures). It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.</p>
<p>We suggested that students were beginning to react to words, books, and visiting speakers with fear and anger because they had been taught to exaggerate danger, use dichotomous (or binary) thinking, amplify their first emotional responses, and engage in a number of other cognitive distortions (which we will discuss further throughout this book). Such thought patterns directly harmed students’ mental health and interfered with their intellectual development—and sometimes the development of those around them.</p>
<p>At some schools, a culture of defensive self-censorship seemed to be emerging, partly in response to students who were quick to “call out” or shame others for small things that they deemed to be insensitive—either to the student doing the calling out or to members of a group that the student was standing up for. We called this pattern <strong>vindictive protectiveness</strong> and argued that such behavior made it more difficult for all students to have open discussions in which they could practice the essential skills of critical thinking and civil disagreement.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>But <strong>overprotection</strong> is just one part of a larger trend that we <strong>call problems of progress</strong>. This term refers to bad consequences produced by otherwise good social changes.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Comfort and physical safety are boons to humanity, but they bring some costs, too. We adapt to our new and improved circumstances and then lower the bar for what we count as intolerable levels of discomfort and risk.</p>
<p>Each generation tends to see the one after it as weak, whiny, and lacking in resilience.</p>
<p>To repeat, we are not saying that the problems facing students, and young people more generally, are minor or “all in their heads.” We are saying that what people choose to do in their heads will determine how those real problems affect them.</p>
<p>That means seeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality).</p>
<h2 id="part-i-three-bad-ideas">PART I Three Bad Ideas</h2>
<h3 id="chapter-1-the-untruth-of-fragility-what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-weaker">CHAPTER 1 The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker</h3>
<p>This is the underlying rationale for what is called the <strong>hygiene hypothesis</strong>, the leading explanation for why allergy rates generally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner—another example of a problem of progress. Developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik explains the hypothesis succinctly and does us the favor of linking it to our mission in this book: Thanks to hygiene, antibiotics and too little outdoor play, children don’t get exposed to microbes as they once did. This may lead them to develop immune systems that overreact to substances that aren’t actually threatening—causing allergies.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Taleb argued that most of us think about risk in the wrong way. In complex systems, it is virtually inevitable that unforeseen problems will arise, yet we persist in trying to calculate risk based on past experiences.</p>
<p>Taleb asks us to look beyond the overused word “resilience” and recognize that some things are <strong>antifragile</strong>. Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like our immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>But gradually, in the twenty-first century, on some college campuses, the meaning of “safety” underwent a process of “concept creep” and expanded to include “emotional safety.”</p>
<p>To understand how an Oberlin administrator could have used the word “safety,” we turn to an article published in 2016 by the Australian psychologist Nick Haslam, titled “Concept Creep: Psychology’s Expanding Concepts of Harm and Pathology.”16 Haslam examined a variety of key concepts in clinical and social psychology—including abuse, bullying, trauma, and prejudice—to determine how their usage had changed since the 1980s. He found that their scope had expanded in two directions: the concepts had crept “downward,” to apply to less severe situations, and “outward,” to encompass new but conceptually related phenomena.</p>
<p>Research on “post-traumatic growth” shows that most people report becoming stronger, or better in some way, after suffering through a traumatic experience. That doesn’t mean we should stop protecting young people from potential trauma, but it does mean that the culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery. It is vital that people who have survived violence become habituated to ordinary cues and reminders woven into the fabric of daily life. <strong>Avoiding triggers is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it.</strong>

<p><strong>“Safetyism”</strong> refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. “Safety” trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger.

<p>Children, like many other complex adaptive systems, are antifragile. Their brains require a wide range of inputs from their environments in order to configure themselves for those environments. Like the immune system, children must be exposed to challenges and stressors (within limits, and in age-appropriate ways), or they will fail to mature into strong and capable adults, able to engage productively with people and ideas that challenge their beliefs and moral convictions.</p>
<p>Concepts sometimes creep. Concepts like trauma and safety have expanded so far since the 1980s that they are often employed in ways that are no longer grounded in legitimate psychological research. Grossly expanded conceptions of trauma and safety are now used to justify the overprotection of children of all ages—even college students, who are sometimes said to need safe spaces and trigger warnings lest words and ideas put them in danger.</p>
<p>Safetyism is the cult of safety—an obsession with eliminating threats (both real and imagined) to the point at which people become unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. Safetyism deprives young people of the experiences that their antifragile minds need, thereby making them more fragile, anxious, and prone to seeing themselves as victims.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-2-the-untruth-of-emotional-reasoning-always-trust-your-feelings">CHAPTER 2 The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings</h3>
<p>Beck noticed a common pattern of beliefs, which he called the “cognitive triad” of depression: “I’m no good,” “My world is bleak,” and “My future is hopeless.” Many people experience one or two of these thoughts fleetingly, but depressed people tend to hold all three beliefs in a stable and enduring psychological structure.</p>
<p><strong>Schemas</strong> refer to the patterns of thoughts and behaviors, built up over time, that people use to process information quickly and effortlessly as they interact with the world.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Beck’s great discovery was that it is possible to break the disempowering feedback cycle between negative beliefs and negative emotions. If you can get people to examine these beliefs and consider counterevidence, it gives them at least some moments of relief from negative emotions, and if you release them from negative emotions, they become more open to questioning their negative beliefs.</p>
<p>A common finding is that CBT works about as well as Prozac and similar drugs for relieving the symptoms of anxiety disorders and mild to moderate depression, and it does so with longer-lasting benefits and without any negative side effects. But CBT is effective for more than anxiety and depression, including anorexia, bulimia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anger, marital discord, and stress-related disorders.

<p>Everyone engages in these distortions from time to time, so CBT is useful for everyone.</p>
<p>Greg’s original realization about cognitive distortions was that just learning how to recognize them and rein them in is a good intellectual habit for all of us to cultivate.</p>
<p>But aggression is not unintentional or accidental. If you bump into someone by accident and never meant them any harm, it is not an act of aggression, although the other person may misperceive it as one.</p>
<p>But it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as <strong>mind reading</strong>; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships.

<p>A faux pas does not make someone an evil person or an aggressor.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that some members of various identity groups encounter repeated indignities because of their group membership. Even if none of the offenders harbored a trace of ill will, their clueless or ignorant questions could become burdensome and hard to tolerate.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> re &ldquo;microaggressions&rdquo;</p>
<p>The concept of <strong>“locus of control”</strong> goes back to behaviorist days, when psychologists noted that animals (including people) could be trained to expect that they could get what they wanted through their own behavior (that is, some control over outcomes was “internal” to themselves). Conversely, animals could be trained to expect that nothing they did mattered (that is, all control of outcomes was “external” to themselves).
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>A great deal of research shows that having an internal locus of control leads to greater health, happiness, effort expended, success in school, and success at work. An internal locus of control has even been found to make many kinds of adversity less painful.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-1">In Sum</h4>
<p>Among the most universal psychological insights in the world’s wisdom traditions is that what really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves but the way in which we think about them, as Epictetus put it.</p>
<p>CBT is a method anyone can learn for identifying common cognitive distortions and then changing their habitual patterns of thinking. CBT helps the rider (controlled processing) to train the elephant (automatic processing), resulting in better critical thinking and mental health.</p>
<p>Emotional reasoning is among the most common of all cognitive distortions; most people would be happier and more effective if they did less of it.</p>
<p>The term <strong>“microaggressions”</strong> refers to a way of thinking about brief and commonplace indignities and slights communicated to people of color (and others). Small acts of aggression are real, so the term could be useful, but because the definition includes accidental and unintentional offenses, the word “aggression” is misleading. Using the lens of microaggressions may amplify the pain experienced and the conflict that ensues. (On the other hand, there is nothing “micro” about intentional acts of aggression and bigotry.)
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>By encouraging students to interpret the actions of others in the least generous way possible, schools that teach students about microaggressions may be encouraging students to engage in emotional reasoning and other distortions while setting themselves up for higher levels of distrust and conflict.</p>
<p>Karith Foster offers an example of using empathy to reappraise actions that could be interpreted as microaggressions. When she interpreted those actions as innocent (albeit insensitive) misunderstandings, it led to a better outcome for everyone.</p>
<p>The number of efforts to “disinvite” speakers from giving talks on campus has increased in the last few years; such efforts are often justified by the claim that the speaker in question will cause harm to students. But discomfort is not danger. Students, professors, and administrators should understand the concept of antifragility and keep in mind Hanna Holborn Gray’s principle: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.”</p>

<p>Tajfel found that no matter how trivial or “minimal” he made the distinctions between the groups, people tended to distribute whatever was offered in favor of their in-group members. Later studies have used a variety of techniques to reach the same conclusion.</p>
<p>Any kind of intergroup conflict (real or perceived) immediately turns tribalism up, making people highly attentive to signs that reveal which team another person is on. &hellip; Conditions of peace and prosperity, in contrast, generally turn down the tribalism.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that the human mind is prepared for tribalism. Human evolution is not just the story of individuals competing with other individuals within each group; it’s also the story of groups competing with other groups—sometimes violently.</p>
<p>But being prepared for tribalism doesn’t mean we have to live in tribal ways. The human mind contains many evolved cognitive “tools.” We don’t use all of them all the time; we draw on our toolbox as needed. Local conditions can turn the tribalism up, down, or off.</p>
<p><strong>“Identity politics”</strong> is a contentious term, but its basic meaning is simple. Jonathan Rauch, a scholar at The Brookings Institution, defines it as “political mobilization organized around group characteristics such as race, gender, and sexuality, as opposed to party, ideology, or pecuniary interest.”
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>But how identity is mobilized makes an enormous difference—for the group’s odds of success, for the welfare of the people who join the movement, and for the country. Identity can be mobilized in ways that emphasize an overarching common humanity while making the case that some fellow human beings are denied dignity and rights because they belong to a particular group, or it can be mobilized in ways that amplify our ancient tribalism and bind people together in shared hatred of a group that serves as the unifying common enemy.</p>
<p>Instead of shaming or demonizing their opponents, they humanized them and then relentlessly appealed to their humanity.</p>
<p>Intersectionality is a theory based on several insights that we believe are valid and useful: power matters, members of groups sometimes act cruelly or unjustly to preserve their power, and people who are members of multiple identity groups can face various forms of disadvantage in ways that are often invisible to others. &hellip; Our purpose here is not to critique the theory itself; it is, rather, to explore the effects that certain interpretations of intersectionality may now be having on college campuses. The human mind is prepared for tribalism, and these interpretations of intersectionality have the potential to turn tribalism way up. These interpretations of intersectionality teach people to see bipolar dimensions of privilege and oppression as ubiquitous in social interactions.</p>
<p>a variety of theories and approaches flourished on campus in humanities and social science departments that offered ways of analyzing society through the lens of power relationships among groups. (Examples include deconstructionism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and critical theory.)</p>
<p>Call-out culture requires an easy way to reach an audience that can award status to people who shame or punish alleged offenders. This is one reason social media has been so transformative: there is always an audience eager to watch people being shamed, particularly when it is so easy for spectators to join in and pile on.</p>
<p>Life in a call-out culture requires constant vigilance, fear, and self-censorship. Many in the audience may feel sympathy for the person being shamed but are afraid to speak up, yielding the false impression that the audience is unanimous in its condemnation.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-2">In Sum</h4>
<p>The human mind evolved for living in tribes that engaged in frequent (and often violent) conflict; our modern-day minds readily divide the world into “us” and “them,” even on trivial or arbitrary criteria, as Henri Tajfel’s psychological experiments demonstrated.</p>
<p>Identity politics takes many forms. Some forms, such as that practiced by Martin Luther King, Jr., and Pauli Murray, can be called common-humanity identity politics, because its practitioners humanize their opponents and appeal to their humanity while also applying political pressure in other ways.</p>
<p>Common-enemy identity politics, on the other hand, tries to unite a coalition using the psychology embedded in the Bedouin proverb “I against my brothers. I and my brothers against my cousins. I and my brothers and my cousins against the world.” It is used on the far right as well as the far left.</p>
<p>Intersectionality is a popular intellectual framework on campuses today; certain versions of it teach students to see multiple axes of privilege and oppression that intersect. While there are merits to the theory, the way it is interpreted and practiced on campus can sometimes amplify tribal thinking and encourage students to endorse the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.</p>
<p>Common-enemy identity politics, when combined with microaggression theory, produces a call-out culture in which almost anything one says or does could result in a public shaming. This can engender a sense of “walking on eggshells,” and it teaches students habits of self-censorship. Call-out cultures are detrimental to students’ education and bad for their mental health. Call-out cultures and us-versus-them thinking are incompatible with the educational and research missions of universities, which require free inquiry, dissent, evidence-based argument, and intellectual honesty.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-4-intimidation-and-violence">CHAPTER 4 Intimidation and Violence</h3>
<p>This is another example of concept creep. In just the last few years, the word “violence” has expanded on campus and in some radical political communities beyond campus to cover a multitude of nonviolent actions, including speech that this political faction claims will have a negative impact on members of protected identity groups. Outside of cultures of safetyism, the word “violence” refers to physical violence. The word is sometimes used metaphorically (as in “I violently disagree”), but few of us, including those who claim that speech is violence, have any difficulty understanding the statement “We should reduce incarceration for nonviolent offenses.” However, now that some students, professors, and activists are labeling their opponents’ words as violence, they give themselves permission to engage in ideologically motivated physical violence.

<p>This sentence includes <strong>fortune-telling</strong>, as the students predict what Mac Donald would say. It also includes a rhetorical flourish that became common in 2017: the assertion that a speaker will “deny” people from certain identity groups “the right to exist.”60 This thinking is a form of catastrophizing, in that it inflates the horrors of a speaker’s words far beyond what the speaker might actually say.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>We understand why so many students embraced more active and confrontational forms of protest. But because their activism is often based on an embrace of the Great Untruths and a tendency to attack potential allies, and because aggressive protests are often exactly what right-wing provocateurs are hoping to provoke, we believe that many student activists are harming themselves as well as their causes.</p>

<p>The “Milo Riot” at UC Berkeley on February 1, 2017, marked a major shift in campus protests. Violence was used successfully to stop a speaker; people were injured, and there were (as far as we can tell) no costs to those who were violent. Some students later justified the violence as a legitimate form of “self-defense” to prevent speech that they said was violent.</p>
<p>Hardly any students say that they themselves would use violence to shut down a speech, but two surveys conducted in late 2017 found that substantial minorities of students (20% in one survey and 30% in the other) said it was sometimes “acceptable” for other students to use violence to prevent a speaker from speaking on campus.</p>
<p>The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a white nationalist killed a peaceful counterprotester and injured others, further raised tensions on campus, especially as provocations from far-right groups increased in the months afterward.</p>
<p>In the fall of 2017, the number of efforts to shut down speakers reached a record level.</p>
<p>In 2017, the idea that speech can be violence (even when it does not involve threats, harassment, or calls for violence) seemed to spread, assisted by the tendency in some circles to focus only on perceived impact, not on intent. Words that give rise to stress or fear for members of some groups are now often regarded as a form of violence.</p>
<p>Speech is not violence. Treating it as such is an interpretive choice, and it is a choice that increases pain and suffering while preventing other, more effective responses, including the Stoic response (cultivating nonreactivity) and the antifragile response suggested by Van Jones: “Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity.”</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-witch-hunts">CHAPTER 5 Witch Hunts</h3>
<p>Durkheim saw groups and communities as being in some ways like organisms—social entities that have a chronic need to enhance their internal cohesion and their shared sense of moral order.</p>
<p>Bergesen notes that there are three features common to most political witch hunts: they arise very quickly, they involve charges of crimes against the collective, and the offenses that lead to charges are often trivial or fabricated.</p>
<p>To Bergesen’s list we’ll add a fourth feature, which necessarily follows from the first three: Fear of defending the accused: When a public accusation is made, many friends and bystanders know that the victim is innocent, but they are afraid to say anything. Anyone who comes to the defense of the accused is obstructing the enactment of a collective ritual. Siding with the accused is truly an offense against the group, and it will be treated as such.</p>
<p>One of the most brilliant features of universities is that, when they are working properly, they are communities of scholars who cancel out one another’s confirmation biases. Even if professors often cannot see the flaws in their own arguments, other professors and students do them the favor of finding such flaws. The community of scholars then judges which ideas survive the debate. We can call this process <strong>institutionalized disconfirmation</strong>. The institution (the academy as a whole, or a discipline, such as political science) guarantees that every statement offered as a research finding—and certainly every peer-reviewed article—has survived a process of challenge and vetting.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>One of the strongest personality correlates of left-wing politics is the trait of openness to experience, a trait that describes people who crave new ideas and experiences and who tend to be interested in changing traditional arrangements.</p>
<p>Social conservatives tend to be lower on openness to experience and higher on conscientiousness—they prefer things to be orderly and predictable, they are more likely to show up on time for meetings, and they are more likely to see the value of traditional arrangements.</p>
<p>Politically homogeneous communities are more susceptible to witch hunts, particularly when they feel threatened from outside.</p>
<p>Humans are tribal creatures who readily form groups to compete with other groups (as we saw in chapter 3). Sociologist Emile Durkheim’s work illuminates the way those groups engage in rituals—including the collective punishment of deviance—to enhance their cohesion and solidarity.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-4">In Sum</h4>
<p>Cohesive and morally homogeneous groups are prone to witch hunts, particularly when they experience a threat, whether from outside or from within.</p>
<p>Witch hunts generally have four properties: they seem to come out of nowhere; they involve charges of crimes against the collective; the offenses that lead to those charges are often trivial or fabricated; and people who know that the accused is innocent keep quiet, or in extreme cases, they join the mob.</p>
<p>Some of the most puzzling campus events and trends since 2015 match the profile of a witch hunt. The campus protests at Yale, Claremont McKenna, and Evergreen all began as reactions to politely worded emails, and all led to demands that the authors of the emails be fired. (We repeat that the concerns that provide the context for a witch hunt may be valid, but in a witch hunt, the attendant fears are channeled in unjust and destructive ways.)</p>
<p>The new trend in 2017 for professors to join open letters denouncing their colleagues and demanding the retraction or condemnation of their work (as happened to Rebecca Tuvel, Amy Wax, and others) also fits this pattern. In all of these cases, colleagues of the accused were afraid to publicly stand up and defend them.</p>
<p>Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. These declines, combined with the rapidly escalating political polarization of the United States (which is our focus in the next chapter), may be part of the reason why the new culture of safetyism has spread so rapidly since its emergence around 2013.</p>
<h2 id="part-iii-how-did-we-get-here">PART III How Did We Get Here?</h2>
<h3 id="chapter-6-the-polarization-cycle">CHAPTER 6 The Polarization Cycle</h3>
<p>What is going on? There is no simple answer. In Part III, we present six interacting explanatory threads: rising political polarization and cross-party animosity; rising levels of teen anxiety and depression; changes in parenting practices; the decline of free play; the growth of campus bureaucracy; and a rising passion for justice in response to major national events, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires.</p>
<p>Before we present these threads, however, we must make two points explicitly and emphatically. The first point is that there are different threads for different people. Part of the complexity of our story is that not all of the threads have influenced each person and group on campus equally. &hellip; The second point is that this is a book about good intentions gone awry. In all of the six chapters in this part of the book, you’ll read about people primarily acting from good or noble motivations. In most cases, the motive is to help or protect children or people seen as vulnerable or victimized. But as we all know, the road to hell can be paved with good intentions. Our goal in Part III is not to blame; it is to understand. Only by identifying and analyzing all six explanatory threads can we begin to talk about possible solutions,</p>
<p>if we step back and look at American universities as complex institutions nested within a larger society that has been growing steadily more divided, angry, and polarized, we begin to see the left and the right locked into a game of mutual provocation and reciprocal outrage that is an essential piece of the puzzle we are trying to solve in this book.</p>
<p>Issue Polarization FIGURE 6.1. The distance between Republicans and Democrats, on a set of 10 policy questions, has grown very large since 2004. Differences by race, gender, education, and age have not changed much since 1994. (Source: Pew Research Center.)</p>
<p>Affective Polarization FIGURE 6.2. Affective partisan polarization. Americans’ feelings toward their own party have barely changed since the 1970s, but Americans have become increasingly “cold” or hostile toward the other party since the 1990s. (Source: American National Election Study,6 plotted by Iyengar and Krupenkin, 2018.)</p>
<p>From the 1940s to around 1980, American politics was about as centrist and bipartisan as it has ever been.</p>
<p>These four trends, plus many more, have combined to produce a very unfortunate change in the dynamics of American politics, which political scientists call negative partisanship. In a recent review of data on <strong>“affective polarization”</strong> (the degree to which members of each party feel negatively toward the other party), Iyengar and Krupenkin summarize the change like this:</p>
<p>Prior to the era of polarization, ingroup favoritism, that is, partisans’ enthusiasm for their party or candidate, was the driving force behind political participation. More recently, however, it is hostility toward the out-party that makes people more inclined to participate. In other words, Americans are now motivated to leave their couches to take part in political action not by love for their party’s candidate but by hatred of the other party’s candidate. Negative partisanship means that American politics is driven less by hope and more by the Untruth of Us Versus Them. “They” must be stopped, at all costs.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Americans are now easily exploitable, and a large network of profit-driven media sites, political entrepreneurs, and foreign intelligence agencies are taking advantage of this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The vulnerability comes with an unfortunate asymmetry: the faculty and students at universities have shifted to the left since the 1990s, as we showed in the last chapter, while the “outrage industry” of talk radio, cable news networks, and conspiracy websites is more developed and effective on the right.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-5">In Sum</h4>
<p>The United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization since the 1980s: affective (or emotional) polarization, which means that people who identify with either of the two main political parties increasingly hate and fear the other party and the people in it. This is our first of six explanatory threads that will help us understand what has been changing on campus.</p>
<p>Affective polarization in the United States is roughly symmetrical, but as university students and faculty have shifted leftward during a time of rising cross-party hatred, universities have begun to receive less trust and more hostility from some conservatives and right-leaning organizations.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2016, the number of high-profile cases of professors being hounded or harassed from the right for something they said in an interview or on social media began to increase.</p>
<p>Rising political polarization, accompanied by increases in racial and political provocation from the right, usually directed from off-campus to on-campus targets, is an essential part of the story of why behavior is changing on campus, particularly since 2016.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-7-anxiety-and-depression">CHAPTER 7 Anxiety and Depression</h3>
<p>In the new discussions about safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, and speech as violence, students often employed arguments and justifications that seemed to come right out of the CBT training manual.</p>
<p>Twenge finds that there are just two activities that are significantly correlated with depression and other suicide-related outcomes (such as considering suicide, making a plan, or making an actual attempt):</p>
<p>electronic device use (such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer) and watching TV.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are five activities that have inverse relationships with depression (meaning that kids who spend more hours per week on these activities show lower rates of depression):</p>
<p>sports and other forms of exercise, attending religious services, reading books and other print media, in-person social interactions, and doing homework</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite, health</p>
<p>The second reason that social media may be harder on girls is that girls and boys are aggressive in different ways. Research by psychologist Nicki Crick shows that boys are more physically aggressive—more likely to shove and hit one another, and they show a greater interest in stories and movies about physical aggression. Girls, in contrast, are more “relationally” aggressive; they try to hurt their rivals’ relationships, reputations, and social status—for example, by using social media to make sure other girls know who is intentionally being left out.33 When you add it all up, there’s no overall sex difference in total aggression, but there’s a large and consistent sex difference in the preferred ways of harming others. (At least, that was Crick’s finding in the 1990s, before the birth of social media.) Plus, if boys’ aggression is generally delivered in person, then the targets of boys’ aggression can escape from it when they go home. On social media, girls can never escape.</p>
<p>Safetyism also inflicts collateral damage on the university’s culture of free inquiry, because it teaches students to see words as violence and to interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous, rather than merely as true versus false. That way of thinking about words is likely to promote the intensification of a call-out culture, which, of course, gives students one more reason to be anxious.</p>
<p>So we don’t want to create a moral panic and frighten parents into banning all devices until their kids turn twenty-one. These are complicated issues, and much more research is needed. In the meantime, as we’ll say in chapter 12, there is enough evidence to support placing time limits on device use (perhaps two hours a day for adolescents, less for younger kids) while limiting or prohibiting the use of platforms that amplify social comparison rather than social connection.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-6">In Sum</h4>
<p>The national rise in adolescent anxiety and depression that began around 2011 is our second explanatory thread.</p>
<p>The generation born between 1995 and 2012, called iGen (or sometimes Gen Z), is very different from the Millennials, the generation that preceded it. According to Jean Twenge, an expert in the study of generational differences, one difference is that iGen is growing up more slowly. On average, eighteen-year-olds today have spent less time unsupervised and have hit fewer developmental milestones on the path to autonomy (such as getting a job or a driver’s license), compared with eighteen-year-olds in previous generations.</p>
<p>A second difference is that iGen has far higher rates of anxiety and depression. The increases for girls and young women are generally much larger than for boys and young men. The increases do not just reflect changing definitions or standards; they show up in rising hospital admission rates of self-harm and in rising suicide rates. The suicide rate of adolescent boys is still higher than that of girls, but the suicide rate of adolescent girls has doubled since 2007.</p>
<p>According to Twenge, the primary cause of the increase in mental illness is frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices. Less than two hours a day seems to have no deleterious effects, but adolescents who spend several hours a day interacting with screens, particularly if they start in their early teen years or younger, have worse mental health outcomes than do adolescents who use these devices less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.</p>
<p>Girls may be suffering more than boys because they are more adversely affected by social comparisons (especially based on digitally enhanced beauty), by signals that they are being left out, and by relational aggression, all of which became easier to enact and harder to escape when adolescents acquired smartphones and social media.</p>
<p>iGen’s arrival at college coincides exactly with the arrival and intensification of the culture of safetyism from 2013 to 2017. Members of iGen may be especially attracted to the overprotection offered by the culture of safetyism on many campuses because of students’ higher levels of anxiety and depression. Both depression and anxiety cause changes in cognition, including a tendency to see the world as more dangerous and hostile than it really is.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-8-paranoid-parenting">CHAPTER 8 Paranoid Parenting</h3>
<p>When you combine the giant crime wave that began in the 1960s with the rapid spread of cable TV in the 1980s, including news channels that offered round-the-clock coverage of missing-child cases, you can see why American parents grew fearful and defensive by the 1990s. The crime wave ended rather abruptly in the early 1990s, when rates of nearly all crimes began to plummet all over the United States. In 2013, for example, the murder rate dropped to the same level it had been at sixty years earlier. Nevertheless, the fear of crime did not diminish along with the crime rate, and the new habits of fearful parenting seem to have become new national norms. American parenting is now wildly out of sync with the actual risk that strangers pose to children.</p>
<p>The lesson we draw from this brief review of research on social class and parenting is that although kids are naturally antifragile, there are two very different ways to damage their development. One is to neglect and underprotect them, exposing them early to severe and chronic adversity. This has happened to some of today’s college students, particularly those from working-class or poor families. The other is to overmonitor and overprotect them, denying them the thousands of small challenges, risks, and adversities that they need to face on their own in order to become strong and resilient adults.</p>
<p>Paranoid parenting is a powerful way to teach kids all three of the Great Untruths.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-7">In Sum</h4>
<p>Paranoid parenting is our third explanatory thread.</p>
<p>When we overprotect children, we harm them. Children are naturally antifragile, so overprotection makes them weaker and less resilient later on.</p>
<p>Children today have far more restricted childhoods, on average, than those enjoyed by their parents, who grew up in far more dangerous times and yet had many more opportunities to develop their intrinsic antifragility. Compared with previous generations, younger Millennials and especially members of iGen (born in and after 1995) have been deprived of unsupervised time for play and exploration. They have missed out on many of the challenges, negative experiences, and minor risks that help children develop into strong, competent, and independent adults (as we’ll show in the next chapter).</p>
<p>Children in the United States and other prosperous countries are safer today than at any other point in history. Yet for a variety of historical reasons, fear of abduction is still very high among American parents, many of whom have come to believe that children should never be without adult supervision. When children are repeatedly led to believe that the world is dangerous and that they cannot face it alone, we should not be surprised if many of them believe it.</p>
<p>Helicopter parenting combined with laws and social norms that make it hard to give kids unsupervised time may be having a negative impact on the mental health and resilience of young people today.</p>
<p>There are large social class differences in parenting styles. Families in the middle class (and above) tend to use a style that sociologist Annette Lareau calls “concerted cultivation,” in contrast to the “natural growth parenting” used by families in the working class (and below). Some college students from wealthier families may have been rendered more fragile from overparenting and oversupervision. College students from poorer backgrounds are exposed to a very different set of risks, including potential exposure to chronic, severe adversity, which is especially detrimental to resilience when children lack caring relationships with adults who can buffer stress and help them turn adversity into growth.</p>
<p>Paranoid parenting prepares today’s children to embrace the three Great Untruths, which means that when they go to college, they are psychologically primed to join a culture of safetyism.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-9-the-decline-of-play">CHAPTER 9 The Decline of Play</h3>
<p>In species that are predators, such as wolves, their pups seem to prefer to be the chasers. In species that are prey, such as rats, the pups prefer to be chased. Our primate ancestors were both prey and predator, but they were prey for much longer. That may be why human children particularly enjoy practicing their fleeing and hiding skills.</p>
<p>A key concept from developmental biology is <strong>“experience-expectant development.”</strong>
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Peter Gray, a leading researcher of play, defines <strong>“free play”</strong> as “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.”
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>When asked to select reasons to explain why their children didn’t spend more time on outdoor play, 82% of the mothers chose “safety concerns,” including the fear of crime. But there’s a second reason, a second fear that haunts American parents and children—particularly those in the middle class and above—far more than it did in the late twentieth century: the college admissions process.</p>
<p>But “grit is often misunderstood as perseverance without passion, and that’s tragic,” psychology professor Angela Duckworth, author of the book Grit, told us. “Perseverance without passion is mere drudgery.” She wants young people to “devote themselves to pursuits that are intrinsically fulfilling.”</p>
<p>Of greatest importance in free play is that it is always voluntary; anyone can quit at any time and disrupt the activity, so children must pay close attention to the needs and concerns of others if they want to keep the game going. They must work out conflicts over fairness on their own; no adult can be called upon to side with one child against another.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-8">In Sum</h4>
<p>The decline of unsupervised free play is our fourth explanatory thread. Children, like other mammals, need free play in order to finish the intricate wiring process of neural development. Children deprived of free play are likely to be less competent—physically and socially—as adults. They are likely to be less tolerant of risk, and more prone to anxiety disorders.</p>
<p>Free play, according to Peter Gray, is “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.” This is the kind of play that play experts say is most valuable for children, yet it is also the kind of play that has declined most sharply in the lives of American children.</p>
<p>The decline in free play was likely driven by several factors, including an unrealistic fear of strangers and kidnapping (since the 1980s); the rising competitiveness for admission to top universities (over many decades); a rising emphasis on testing, test preparation, and homework; and a corresponding deemphasis on physical and social skills (since the early 2000s).</p>
<p>The rising availability of smartphones and social media interacted with these other trends, and the combination has greatly changed the way American children spend their time and the kinds of physical and social experiences that guide the intricate wiring process of neural development.</p>
<p>Free play helps children develop the skills of cooperation and dispute resolution that are closely related to the “art of association” upon which democracies depend. When citizens are not skilled in this art, they are less able to work out the ordinary conflicts of daily life. They will more frequently call for authorities to apply coercive force to their opponents. They will be more likely to welcome the bureaucracy of safetyism.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-10-the-bureaucracy-of-safetyism">CHAPTER 10 The Bureaucracy of Safetyism</h3>
<p>In 1963, Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California system, called the resulting structure the <strong>“multiversity.”</strong> In a multiversity, different departments and power structures within a university pursue different goals in parallel—for example, research, education, fundraising, branding, and legal compliance.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>A less immediately obvious downside is that goals other than academic excellence begin to take priority as universities come to resemble large corporations—a trend often bemoaned as <strong>“corporatization.”</strong>
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Eric Adler, a classics professor at the University of Maryland, distilled the argument in a 2018 Washington Post article. “The fundamental cause [of campus intolerance],” he suggests, “isn’t students’ extreme leftism or any other political ideology” but “a market-driven decision by universities, made decades ago, to treat students as consumers</p>
<p>Even at public universities, 18-year-olds are purchasing what is essentially a luxury product. Is it any wonder they feel entitled to control the experience?</p>
<p>Overreaction and overregulation are usually the work of people within bureaucratic structures who have developed a mindset commonly known as CYA (Cover Your Ass). They know they can be held responsible for any problem that arises on their watch, especially if they took no action to prevent it, so they often adopt a defensive stance.</p>
<p>Young people have come to believe that danger lurks everywhere, even in the classroom, and even in private conversations.</p>
<p>Of course, there should be an easy way to report cases of true harassment and employment discrimination; such actions are immoral and unlawful. But bias alone is not harassment or discrimination.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Departments of Education and Justice issued a sweeping new definition of harassment: any “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” including “verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct.” This definition was not limited to speech that would be offensive to a reasonable person, nor did it require that the alleged target actually be offended—both requirements of traditional harassment claims. By eliminating the reasonable-person standard, harassment was left to be defined by the self-reported subjective experience of every member of the university community. It was, in effect, emotional reasoning turned into a federal regulation.</p>
<p>In a prescient essay in 2014, two sociologists—Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning—explained where this new culture of vulnerability came from and how administrative actions helped it to grow. They called it -<strong>“victimhood culture,”</strong> and they interpreted it as a new moral order that was in conflict with the older “dignity culture,” which is still dominant in most parts of the United States and other Western democracies.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the older “honor cultures,” in which men were so obsessed with guarding their reputations that they were expected to react violently to minor insults made against them or those close to them—perhaps with a challenge to a duel.</p>
<p>They defined a victimhood culture as having three distinct attributes: First, “individuals and groups display high sensitivity to slight”; second, they “have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to third parties”; and third, they “seek to cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assistance.”</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-9">In Sum</h4>
<p>The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of its protective mission is our fifth explanatory thread.</p>
<p>Administrators generally have good intentions; they are trying to protect the university and its students. But good intentions can sometimes lead to policies that are bad for students.</p>
<p>In response to a variety of factors, including federal mandates and the risk of lawsuits, the number of campus administrators has grown more rapidly than the number of professors, and professors have gradually come to play a smaller role in the administration of universities. The result has been a trend toward “corporatization.”</p>
<p>At the same time, market pressures, along with an increasingly consumerist mentality about higher education, have encouraged universities to compete on the basis of the amenities they offer, leading them to think of students as customers whom they must please.</p>
<p>Campus administrators must juggle many responsibilities and protect the university from many kinds of liabilities, so they tend to adopt a “better safe than sorry” (or “CYA”) approach to issuing new regulations. The proliferation of regulations over time conveys a sense of imminent danger even when there is little or no real threat. In this way, administrators model multiple cognitive distortions, promote the Untruth of Fragility, and contribute to the culture of safetyism.</p>
<p>Some of the regulations promulgated by administrators restrict freedom of speech, often with highly subjective definitions of key concepts. These rules contribute to an attitude on campus that chills speech, in part by suggesting that freedom of speech can or should be restricted because of some students’ emotional discomfort. This teaches catastrophizing and mind reading (among other cognitive distortions) and promotes the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning.</p>
<p>One recent administrative innovation is the creation of “Bias Response Lines” and “Bias Response Teams,” which make it easy for members of a campus community to report one another anonymously for “bias.” This “feel something, say something” approach is likely to erode trust within a community. It may also make professors less willing to try innovative or provocative teaching methods; they, too, may develop a CYA approach. More generally, efforts to protect students by creating bureaucratic means of resolving problems and conflicts can have the unintended consequence of fostering moral dependence, which may reduce students’ ability to resolve conflicts independently both during and after college.</p>
<h3 id="chapter-11-the-quest-for-justice">CHAPTER 11 The Quest for Justice</h3>
<p>there is a window of higher impressionability running from about age fourteen to twenty-four, with its peak right around age eighteen. Political events—or perhaps the overall zeitgeist as people perceive it—are more likely to “stick” during that period than outside that age range.</p>
<p>Today’s college students have lived through extraordinary times, and, as a result, many of them have developed an extraordinary passion for social justice. That passion, which drives some of the changes we are seeing on college campuses in recent years, is our sixth explanatory thread.</p>
<h4 id="intuitive-justice">Intuitive Justice</h4>
<p><strong>Intuitive justice</strong> is the combination of distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Proportionality is the heart of <strong>“equity theory,”</strong> the major theory of distributive justice in social psychology. Its core assertion is that when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants, people perceive that to be equitable, or fair.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>An early study testing equity theory found that when people were led to believe that they were being overpaid for a job, they worked harder in order to deserve the pay—to get their ratio back into line.</p>
<p>people are much more willing to accept a decision or action, even one that goes against themselves, when they perceive that the process that led to the decision was fair.</p>
<p>There are two basic concerns that people bring to their judgments of procedural justice. The first is how the decision is being made. &hellip; The second basic concern is how a person is being treated along the way,</p>
<p>If you want to motivate people to support a new policy or join a movement in the name of justice, you need to activate in them a clear perception, or intuition, that someone didn’t get what he or she deserved (distributive injustice) or that someone was a victim of an unfair process (procedural injustice).</p>
<h4 id="proportional-procedural-social-justice">Proportional-Procedural Social Justice</h4>
<p>Here’s a definition of <strong>social justice</strong> that accords with intuitive notions of justice, from the National Association of Social Workers: “Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social workers aim to open the doors of access and opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.”
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Using that definition of social justice, we’ll define <strong>proportional-procedural social justice</strong> as the effort to find and fix cases where distributive or procedural justice is denied to people because they were born into poverty or belong to a socially disadvantaged category.
<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>In our account, proportional-procedural social justice falls entirely within the larger domain of intuitive justice. That doesn’t mean we should discard the term “social justice.” Some injustices based on race, gender, or other factors (and their intersections) are obvious, but others are subtle, and people who do not experience them can be unaware of them (as Kimberlé Crenshaw noted). It is useful to have specialists within the domain of justice research who focus on this subset of injustices. Furthermore, when such injustices are pointed out, members of the majority group are often motivated to ignore or deny them.</p>
<h4 id="equal-outcomes-social-justice">Equal-Outcomes Social Justice</h4>
<p>When the federal government pressures universities to achieve equal outcomes in the face of unequal inputs, administrators do what they can to protect the institution. That might require them to violate procedural justice, distributive justice, and honesty along the way.</p>
<p>Most people want individuals to be treated well, and they recoil from cases where individuals are treated unfairly in order to bring about some kind of group-level equality. This is why quotas generally produce such strong backlash: they mandate a violation of procedural justice (people are treated differently based on their race, sex, or some other factor) and distributive justice (rewards are not proportional to inputs) to achieve a specific end-state of equal outcomes.</p>
<p>When you see a situation in which some groups are underrepresented, it is an invitation to investigate and find out whether there are obstacles, a hostile climate, or systemic factors that have a disparate impact on members of those groups.</p>
<h4 id="correlation-does-not-imply-causation">Correlation Does Not Imply Causation</h4>
<p>If professors and students are hesitant to raise alternative explanations for outcome gaps, then theories about those gaps may harden into orthodoxy. Ideas may be accepted not because they are true but because the politically dominant group wants them to be true in order to promote its preferred narrative and preferred set of remedies.</p>
<p>Students today are fighting for many causes that we believe are noble, too, including ending racial injustices in the legal system and in encounters with the police; providing equal educational and other opportunities for everyone, regardless of circumstances at birth; and extinguishing cultural habits that encourage or enable sexual harassment and gender inequalities. On these and many other issues, we think student protesters are on the “right side of history,” and we support their goals. But if activists embrace the equal-outcomes form of social justice—if they interpret all deviations from population norms as evidence of systemic bias—then they will get drawn into endless and counterproductive campaigns, even against people who share their goals. Along the way, they will reinforce the bad mental habits that we have described throughout the book.</p>
<p>As long as activists keep their eyes on the two components of intuitive justice that all of us carry in our minds—distributive and procedural—they will apply their efforts where they are likely to do the most good, and they will win more widespread support along the way.</p>
<h4 id="in-sum-10">In Sum</h4>
<p>People’s ordinary, everyday, intuitive notions of justice include two major types: distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).</p>
<p>The most common way that people think about distributive justice is captured by equity theory, which states that things are perceived to be fair when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants.</p>
<p>Procedural justice is about how decisions are being made, and is also about how people are treated along the way, as procedures unfold.</p>
<p>Social justice is a central concept in campus life today, and it takes a variety of forms. When social justice efforts are fully consistent with both distributive and procedural justice, we call it proportional-procedural social justice. Such efforts generally aim to remove barriers to equality of opportunity and also to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity.</p>
<p>But when social justice efforts aim to achieve equality of outcomes by group, and when social justice activists are willing to violate distributive or procedural fairness for some individuals along the way, these efforts violate many people’s sense of intuitive justice. We call this equal-outcomes social justice.</p>
<p>Correlation does not imply causation. Yet in many discussions in universities these days, the correlation of a demographic trait or identity group membership with an outcome gap is taken as evidence that discrimination (structural or individual) caused the outcome gap. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t, but if people can’t raise alternative possible causal explanations without eliciting negative consequences, then the community is unlikely to arrive at an accurate understanding of the problem. And without understanding the true nature of a problem, there is little chance of solving it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.</li>
<li>Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind).</li>
<li>Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.</li>
<li>Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them.</li>

<p>Foster school spirit.</p>
<p>Protect physical safety.</p>
<p>Host civil, cross-partisan events for students.</p>
<p>Five questions alumni, parents, college counselors, and prospective students should ask universities: What steps do you take (if any) to teach incoming students about academic freedom and free inquiry before they take their first classes? How would you handle a demand that a professor be fired because of an opinion he or she expressed in an article or interview, which other people found deeply offensive? What would your institution do if a controversial speaker were scheduled to speak, and large protests that included credible threats of violence were planned? How is your institution responding to the increase in students who suffer from anxiety and depression? What does your university do to foster a sense of shared identity?</p>
<p>Look for answers that indicate that the institution has a high tolerance for vigorous disagreement but no tolerance for violence or intimidation. Look for answers that indicate a presumption that students are antifragile, combined with the recognition that many students today need support as they work toward emotional growth. Look for answers that indicate that the institution tries to draw an encompassing circle around its members, within which differences can more productively be explored.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-1-how-to-do-cbt">APPENDIX 1 How to Do CBT</h2>
<p>The beauty of CBT is how easy it is to learn: All you need is pen and paper (or a laptop, or a device with an app that lets you take notes). The specific details for practicing CBT differ from book to book and therapist to therapist, but the basic process is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you are feeling anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed, take a moment to write down what you are feeling.</li>
<li>Write down your level of distress. (For example, you could score it on a scale of 1 to 100.)</li>
<li>Write down what happened and what your automatic thoughts were when you felt the pang of anxiety or despair. (For example, “Someone I was interested in canceled our date. I said to myself, ‘This always happens. No one will ever want to go out with me. I’m a total loser.’”)</li>
<li>Look at the categories of distorted automatic thoughts below, and ask yourself: Is this thought a cognitive distortion? Write down the cognitive distortions you notice. (For example, looking at the automatic thoughts in number 3 above, you might write, “personalizing, overgeneralizing, labeling, and catastrophizing.”)</li>
<li>Look at the evidence for and against your thought.</li>
<li>Ask yourself what someone might say who disagreed with you. Is there any merit in that opinion?</li>
<li>Consider again what happened, and reevaluate the situation without the cognitive distortions.</li>
<li>Write down your new thoughts and feelings. (For example, “I am sad and disappointed that a date I was excited about got canceled.”)</li>
<li>Write down again, using the same scale as before, how anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed you feel. Chances are the number will be lower—perhaps a lot lower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Categories of Distorted Automatic Thoughts</p>
<ul>
<li>MIND READING: You assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”</li>
<li>FORTUNE-TELLING: You predict the future negatively: Things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam,” or “I won’t get the job.”</li>
<li>CATASTROPHIZING: You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”</li>
<li>LABELING: You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”</li>
<li>DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”</li>
<li>NEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.” *
OVERGENERALIZING: You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”</li>
<li>DICHOTOMOUS THINKING: You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”</li>
<li>SHOULDS: You interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than simply focusing on what is. “I should do well. If I don’t, then I’m a failure.”</li>
<li>PERSONALIZING: You attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative events, and you fail to see that certain events are also caused by others. “The marriage ended because I failed.”</li>
<li>BLAMING: You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”</li>
<li>UNFAIR COMPARISONS: You interpret events in terms of standards that are unrealistic—for example, you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison. “She’s more successful than I am,” or “Others did better than I did on the test.”</li>
<li>REGRET ORIENTATION: You focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past, rather than on what you can do better now. “I could have had a better job if I had tried,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.”</li>
<li>WHAT IF?: You keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”</li>
<li>EMOTIONAL REASONING: You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”</li>
<li>INABILITY TO DISCONFIRM: You reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought “I’m unlovable,” you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.&quot;</li>
<li>JUDGMENT FOCUS: You view yourself, others, and events in terms of evaluations as good–bad or superior–inferior, rather than simply describing, accepting, or understanding. You are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standards, and finding that you and others fall short. You are focused on the judgments of others as well as your own judgments of yourself. “I didn’t perform well in college,” or “If I take up tennis, I won’t do well,” or “Look how successful she is. I’m not successful.”</li>

			 <p>I hedged and waited for months, but finally got the <a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma">Boox Palma</a>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had it for a few days and it&rsquo;s doing exactly what it&rsquo;s supposed to:</p>
<p><strong>keep my phone out of my hand</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve left my phone in other rooms many times at home. I&rsquo;ve taken walks without it. I even left my phone in the car at a concert (and took an OCR of the schedule to refer to in the <em>Palma</em>). Between a watch with cellular ability to catch me in an emergency, and this Palma, the desire to have a device to &ldquo;do stuff&rdquo; or &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; fades away.</p>
<p>The OS is based on Android and it&rsquo;s a little sketchy, but I&rsquo;m only going to use this for reading, and am locking it down otherwise.</p>
<p>Oh, and of course I&rsquo;m <strong>reading much more</strong>, too.</p>
<p>To that end, I&rsquo;ve installed:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise and Reader</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kobo.com/us/en/p/ereaders-apps">Kobo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://read.amazon.com/kindle-library">Kindle</a></li>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/toddgrotenhuis">Storygraph</a></li>
<li><a href="https://micro.blog/discover/books/grid">Epilogue</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of these work great! There have been a couple hiccups:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kindle and Readwise don&rsquo;t play well together with highlights on the e-ink. Readwise adds a <a href="https://readwise.io/tags">tag</a> for any highlight color that&rsquo;s not the default neon yellow<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, and neon yellow doesn&rsquo;t show up well on the default layout in Kindle. I worked around this by switching to the &ldquo;dark mode&rdquo; theme in Kindle and sticking with the default highlights.</li>
<li>Micro.blog/Epilogue doesn&rsquo;t support passwords<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, so you have to hand copy in an app token or risk turning the Palma into pocket computer with email and web browser, defeating the purpose of the device!</li>
</ol>
<p>Reader has been the standout winner. It has access to all my saved articles, important newsfeeds, and my DRM free ebooks (including a great collection from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a>). In addition, it has a lot of smart extra features, like &ldquo;volume buttons for page turn&rdquo; and other quality-of-life improvements over other article, feed, or book readers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very glad I got this, and kicking myself a little for waiting so long.</p>

<h1 id="my-reading-highlights-and-notes">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>
<p>His questions can be asked about all technologies and media. What happens to us when we become infatuated with and then seduced by them? Do they free us or imprison us? Do they improve or degrade democracy? Do they make our leaders more accountable or less so? Our system more transparent or less so? Do they make us better citizens or better consumers? Are the trade-offs worth it? If they’re not worth it, yet we still can’t stop ourselves from embracing the next new thing because that’s just how we’re wired, then what strategies can we devise to maintain control? Dignity? Meaning?</p>
<p>This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.</p>
<h2 id="part-i">Part I.</h2>
<h3 id="1-the-medium-is-the-metaphor">1. The Medium Is the Metaphor</h3>
<p>Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.</p>
<p>There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality.</p>
<p>We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it.</p>
<p>It is an argument that fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.</p>
<p>For on television, discourse is conducted largely through visual imagery, which is to say that television gives us a conversation in images, not words. The emergence of the image-manager in the political arena and the concomitant decline of the speech writer attest to the fact that television demands a different kind of content from other media. You cannot do political philosophy on television. Its form works against the content.</p>
<p>We attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation.</p>
<p>the clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation.</p>
<p>People like ourselves who are in the process of converting their culture from word-centered to image-centered might profit by reflecting on this Mosaic injunction.</p>
<p>We know enough about language to understand that variations in the structures of languages will result in variations in what may be called “world view.” How people think about time and space, and about things and processes, will be greatly influenced by the grammatical features of their language.</p>
<p>Each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.</p>
<p>person who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a book, television, or a watch.</p>
<p>In Mumford’s great book Technics and Civilization, he shows how, beginning in the fourteenth century, the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it is clear that phonetic writing created a new conception of knowledge, as well as a new sense of intelligence, of audience and of posterity, all of which Plato recognized at an early stage in the development of texts.</p>
<p>Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist—all those who must hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading.</p>
<p>what my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of electronics.</p>
<p>We are told in school, quite correctly, that a metaphor suggests what a thing is like by comparing it to something else. And by the power of its suggestion, it so fixes a conception in our minds that we cannot imagine the one thing without the other:</p>
<p>in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself.</p>
<p>Eyeglasses refuted the belief that anatomy is destiny by putting forward the idea that our bodies as well as our minds are improvable.</p>
<p>And our languages are our media. Our media are our metaphors. Our metaphors create the content of our culture.</p>
<h3 id="2-media-as-epistemology">2. Media as Epistemology</h3>
<p>It is my intention in this book to show that a great media-metaphor shift has taken place in America, with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense.</p>
<p>I raise no objection to television’s junk. The best things on television are its junk, and no one and nothing is seriously threatened by it.</p>
<p>we do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by what it claims as significant.</p>
<p>Therein is our problem, for television is at its most trivial and, therefore, most dangerous when its aspirations are high, when it presents itself as a carrier of important cultural conversations.</p>
<p>Whatever the original and limited context of its use may have been, a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones. Because of the way it directs us to organize our minds and integrate our experience of the world, it imposes itself on our consciousness and social institutions in myriad forms. It sometimes has the power to become implicated in our concepts of piety, or goodness, or beauty. And it is always implicated in the ways we define and regulate our ideas of truth.</p>
<p>For in a print-based courtroom, where law books, briefs, citations and other written materials define and organize the method of finding the truth, the oral tradition has lost much of its resonance—but not all of it. Testimony is expected to be given orally, on the assumption that the spoken, not the written, word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness. Indeed, in many courtrooms jurors are not permitted to take notes, nor are they given written copies of the judge’s explanation of the law. Jurors are expected to hear the truth, or its opposite, not to read it. Thus, we may say that there is a clash of resonances in our concept of legal truth.</p>
<p>the written word is, by its nature, addressed to the world, not an individual.</p>
<p>The written word endures, the spoken word disappears; and that is why writing is closer to the truth than speaking.</p>
<p>the concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. Truth does not, and never has, come unadorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is not acknowledged, which is a way of saying that the “truth” is a kind of cultural prejudice. Each culture conceives of it as being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms that another culture may regard as trivial or irrelevant.</p>
<p>“Seeing is believing” has always had a preeminent status as an epistemological axiom, but “saying is believing,” “reading is believing,” “counting is believing,” “deducing is believing,” and “feeling is believing” are others that have risen or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change.</p>
<p>Since intelligence is primarily defined as one’s capacity to grasp the truth of things, it follows that what a culture means by intelligence is derived from the character of its important forms of communication.</p>
<p>My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of content—in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling.</p>
<p>I am arguing that a television-based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape, not that it pollutes everything.</p>
<p>I will try to demonstrate that as typography moves to the periphery of our culture and television takes its place at the center, the seriousness, clarity and, above all, value of public discourse dangerously declines.</p>
<h3 id="3-typographic-america">3. Typographic America</h3>
<p>The Dunkers came close here to formulating a commandment about religious discourse: Thou shalt not write down thy principles, still less print them, lest thou shall be entrapped by them for all time.</p>
<p>the Lyceum Movement had as its purpose the diffusion of knowledge, the promotion of common schools, the creation of libraries and, especially, the establishment of lecture halls.</p>
<p>The influence of the printed word in every arena of public discourse was insistent and powerful not merely because of the quantity of printed matter but because of its monopoly.</p>
<h3 id="4-the-typographic-mind">4. The Typographic Mind</h3>
<p>Is there any audience of Americans today who could endure seven hours of talk? or five? or three? Especially without pictures of any kind?</p>
<p>Whenever language is the principal medium of communication—especially language controlled by the rigors of print—an idea, a fact, a claim is the inevitable result. The idea may be banal, the fact irrelevant, the claim false, but there is no escape from meaning when language is the instrument guiding one’s thought.</p>
<p>As a consequence a language-centered discourse such as was characteristic of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America tends to be both content-laden and serious, all the more so when it takes its form from print.</p>
<p>A written sentence calls upon its author to say something, upon its reader to know the import of what is said.</p>
<p>The reader must come armed, in a serious state of intellectual readiness. This is not easy because he comes to the text alone. In reading, one’s responses are isolated, one’s intellect thrown back on its own resources. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community.</p>
<p>In a print culture, writers make mistakes when they lie, contradict themselves, fail to support their generalizations, try to enforce illogical connections. In a print culture, readers make mistakes when they don’t notice, or even worse, don’t care.</p>
<p>If we may take advertising to be the voice of commerce, then its history tells very clearly that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries those with products to sell took their customers to be not unlike Daniel Webster: they assumed that potential buyers were literate, rational, analytical.</p>
<p>Indeed, the history of newspaper advertising in America may be considered, all by itself, as a metaphor of the descent of the typographic mind, beginning, as it does, with reason, and ending, as it does, with entertainment.</p>
<p>Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory. It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers and scientists of that era. To think about those men was to think about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word. You may get some sense of how we are separated from this kind of consciousness by thinking about any of our recent presidents; or even preachers, lawyers and scientists who are or who have recently been public figures. Think of Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of a face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein’s case, a photograph of a face). Of words, almost nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture.</p>
<p>For two centuries, America declared its intentions, expressed its ideology, designed its laws, sold its products, created its literature and addressed its deities with black squiggles on white paper.</p>
<p>The name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition.</p>
<p>Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-peek-a-boo-world">5. The Peek-a-Boo World</h3>
<p>Thoreau, as it turned out, was precisely correct. He grasped that the telegraph would create its own definition of discourse; that it would not only permit but insist upon a conversation between Maine and Texas; and that it would require the content of that conversation to be different from what Typographic Man was accustomed to.</p>
<p>telegraphy gave a form of legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action, but may attach merely to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a “thing” that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.</p>
<p>telegraphy made relevance irrelevant. The abundant flow of information had very little or nothing to do with those to whom it was addressed; that is, with any social or intellectual context in which their lives were embedded.</p>
<p>How often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or provides insight into some problem you are required to solve?</p>
<p>most of our daily news is inert, consisting of information that gives us something to talk about but cannot lead to any meaningful action. This fact is the principal legacy of the telegraph: By generating an abundance of irrelevant information, it dramatically altered what may be called the “information-action ratio.”

<p>You may get a sense of what this means by asking yourself another series of questions: What steps do you plan to take to reduce the conflict in the Middle East? Or the rates of inflation, crime and unemployment? What are your plans for preserving the environment or reducing the risk of nuclear war? What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, the CIA, affirmative action, and the monstrous treatment of the Baha’is in Iran? I shall take the liberty of answering for you: You plan to do nothing about them. You may, of course, cast a ballot for someone who claims to have some plans, as well as the power to act. But this you can do only once every two or four years by giving one hour of your time, hardly a satisfying means of expressing the broad range of opinions you hold.</p>
<p>We may say then that the contribution of the telegraph to public discourse was to dignify irrelevance and amplify impotence.</p>
<p>The principal strength of the telegraph was its capacity to move information, not collect it, explain it or analyze it. In this respect, telegraphy was the exact opposite of typography. Books, for example, are an excellent container for the accumulation, quiet scrutiny and organized analysis of information and ideas.</p>
<p>“Knowing” the facts took on a new meaning, for it did not imply that one understood implications, background, or connections.</p>
<p>In a peculiar way, the photograph was the perfect complement to the flood of telegraphic news-from-nowhere that threatened to submerge readers in a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces. For the photograph gave a concrete reality to the strange-sounding datelines, and attached faces to the unknown names. Thus it provided the illusion, at least, that “the news” had a connection to something within one’s sensory experience. It created an apparent context for the “news of the day.” And the “news of the day” created a context for the photograph.</p>
<p>It may be of some interest to note, in this connection, that the crossword puzzle became a popular form of diversion in America at just that point when the telegraph and the photograph had achieved the transformation of news from functional information to decontextualized fact. This coincidence suggests that the new technologies had turned the age-old problem of information on its head: Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context; the cocktail party is another; the radio quiz shows of the 1930s and 1940s and the modern television game show are still others; and the ultimate, perhaps, is the wildly successful “Trivial Pursuit.” In one form or another, each of these supplies an answer to the question, “What am I to do with all these disconnected facts?” And in one form or another, the, answer is the same: Why not use them for diversion? for entertainment? to amuse yourself, in a game?</p>
<p>the loss of the sense of the strange is a sign of adjustment, and the extent to which we have adjusted is a measure of the extent to which we have been changed.</p>
<p>I will try to demonstrate by concrete example that television’s way of knowing is uncompromisingly hostile to typography’s way of knowing; that television’s conversations promote incoherence and triviality; that the phrase “serious television” is a contradiction in terms; and that television speaks in only one persistent voice—the voice of entertainment.</p>
<h2 id="part-ii">Part II.</h2>
<h3 id="6-the-age-of-show-business">6. The Age of Show Business</h3>
<p>If television is a continuation of anything, it is of a tradition begun by the telegraph and photograph in the mid-nineteenth century, not by the printing press in the fifteenth.</p>
<p>I must begin by making a distinction between a technology and a medium. We might say that a technology is to a medium as the brain is to the mind. Like the brain, a technology is a physical apparatus. Like the mind, a medium is a use to which a physical apparatus is put. A technology becomes a medium as it employs a particular symbolic code, as it finds its place in a particular social setting, as it insinuates itself into economic and political contexts. A technology, in other words, is merely a machine. A medium is the social and intellectual environment a machine creates.</p>
<p>every technology has an inherent bias. It has within its physical form a predisposition toward being used in certain ways and not others.</p>
<p>The average length of a shot on network television is only 3.5 seconds, so that the eye never rests, always has something new to see.
<strong>Note:</strong> surely much shorter since this was written</p>
<p>what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience. Our television set keeps us in constant communion with the world, but it does so with a face whose smiling countenance is unalterable. The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue altogether.</p>
<p>There is no conspiracy here, no lack of intelligence, only a straightforward recognition that “good television” has little to do with what is “good” about exposition or other forms of verbal communication but everything to do with what the pictorial images look like.</p>
<p>almost all television programs are embedded in music, which helps to tell the audience what emotions are to be called forth.</p>
<p>When a television show is in process, it is very nearly impermissible to say, “Let me think about that” or “I don’t know” or “What do you mean when you say . . . ?” or “From what sources does your information come?” This type of discourse not only slows down the tempo of the show but creates the impression of uncertainty or lack of finish.</p>
<p>Thinking does not play well on television, a fact that television directors discovered long ago. There is not much to see in it. It is, in a phrase, not a performing art.</p>
<p>The single most important fact about television is that people watch it, which is why it is called “television.” And what they watch, and like to watch, are moving pictures—millions of them, of short duration and dynamic variety. It is in the nature of the medium that it must suppress the content of ideas in order to accommodate the requirements of visual interest; that is to say, to accommodate the values of show business.</p>
<p>how television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged. It is not merely that on the television screen entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails. As typography once dictated the style of conducting politics, religion, business, education, law and other important social matters, television now takes command.</p>
<p>Post-debate commentary largely avoided any evaluation of the candidates’ ideas, since there were none to evaluate. Instead, the debates were conceived as boxing matches, the relevant question being, Who KO’d whom?</p>
<p>Our priests and presidents, our surgeons and lawyers, our educators and newscasters need worry less about satisfying the demands of their discipline than the demands of good showmanship.</p>
<h3 id="7-now-this">7. “Now . . . This”</h3>
<p>“Now . . . this” is commonly used on radio and television newscasts to indicate that what one has just heard or seen has no relevance to what one is about to hear or see, or possibly to anything one is ever likely to hear or see.</p>
<p>Television did not invent the “Now . . . this” world view. As I have tried to show, it is the offspring of the intercourse between telegraphy and photography.</p>
<p>Stated in its simplest form, it is that television provides a new (or, possibly, restores an old) definition of truth: The credibility of the teller is the ultimate test of the truth of a proposition. “Credibility” here does not refer to the past record of the teller for making statements that have survived the rigors of reality-testing. It refers only to the impression of sincerity, authenticity, vulnerability or attractiveness (choose one or more) conveyed by the actor/reporter.</p>
<p>it is quite obvious that TV news has no intention of suggesting that any story has any implications, for that would require viewers to continue to think about it when it is done and therefore obstruct their attending to the next story that waits panting in the wings.</p>
<p>The viewers also know that no matter how grave any fragment of news may appear (for example, on the day I write a Marine Corps general has declared that nuclear war between the United States and Russia is inevitable), it will shortly be followed by a series of commercials that will, in an instant, defuse the import of the news, in fact render it largely banal.</p>
<p>Imagine what you would think of me, and this book, if I were to pause here, tell you that I will return to my discussion in a moment, and then proceed to write a few words in behalf of United Airlines or the Chase Manhattan Bank. You would rightly think that I had no respect for you and, certainly, no respect for the subject. And if I did this not once but several times in each chapter, you would think the whole enterprise unworthy of your attention. Why, then, do we not think a news show similarly unworthy? The reason, I believe, is that whereas we expect books and even other media (such as film) to maintain a consistency of tone and a continuity of content, we have no such expectation of television, and especially television news. We have become so accustomed to its discontinuities that we are no longer struck dumb, as any sane person would be, by a newscaster who having just reported that a nuclear war is inevitable goes on to say that he will be right back after this word from Burger King; who says, in other words, “Now . . . this.”</p>
<p>Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information—information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result.</p>
<p>in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?</p>
<p>Huxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions.</p>
<p>America’s newest and highly successful national newspaper, USA Today, is modeled precisely on the format of television.</p>
<p>In the age of television, the paragraph is becoming the basic unit of news in print media.</p>
<p>the time cannot be far off when awards will be given for the best investigative sentence.</p>
<p>Whereas television taught the magazines that news is nothing but entertainment, the magazines have taught television that nothing but entertainment is news.</p>
<h3 id="8-shuffle-off-to-bethlehem">8. Shuffle Off to Bethlehem</h3>
<p>on television, religion, like everything else, is presented, quite simply and without apology, as an entertainment. Everything that makes religion an historic, profound and sacred human activity is stripped away; there is no ritual, no dogma, no tradition, no theology, and above all, no sense of spiritual transcendence. On these shows, the preacher is tops. God comes out as second banana.</p>
<p>there is always the question, What is lost in the translation?</p>
<p>To come to the point, there are several characteristics of television and its surround that converge to make authentic religious experience impossible. The first has to do with the fact that there is no way to consecrate the space in which a television show is experienced.</p>
<p>The executive director of the National Religious Broadcasters Association sums up what he calls the unwritten law of all television preachers: “You can get your share of the audience only by offering people something they want.”[3] You will note, I am sure, that this is an unusual religious credo. There is no great religious leader—from the Buddha to Moses to Jesus to Mohammed to Luther—who offered people what they want. Only what they need.</p>
<p>what is preached on television is not anything like the Sermon on the Mount. Religious programs are filled with good cheer.</p>
<p>I think it both fair and obvious to say that on television, God is a vague and subordinate character. Though His name is invoked repeatedly, the concreteness and persistence of the image of the preacher carries the clear message that it is he, not He, who must be worshipped. I do not mean to imply that the preacher wishes it to be so; only that the power of a close-up televised face, in color, makes idolatry a continual hazard. Television is, after all, a form of graven imagery far more alluring than a golden calf.</p>
<h3 id="9-reach-out-and-elect-someone">9. Reach Out and Elect Someone</h3>
<p>If politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether. And what the other matter is can be expressed in one word: advertising.</p>
<p>One can like or dislike a television commercial, of course. But one cannot refute it. Indeed, we may go this far: The television commercial is not at all about the character of products to be consumed. It is about the character of the consumers of products.</p>
<p>What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer. And so, the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research.</p>
<p>The television commercial has oriented business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable, which means that the business of business has now become pseudo-therapy.</p>
<p>The commercial asks us to believe that all problems are solvable, that they are solvable fast, and that they are solvable fast through the interventions of technology, techniques and chemistry. This is, of course, a preposterous theory about the roots of discontent, and would appear so to anyone hearing or reading it.</p>
<p>television makes impossible the determination of who is better than whom, if we mean by “better” such things as more capable in negotiation, more imaginative in executive skill, more knowledgeable about international affairs, more understanding of the interrelations of economic systems, and so on.</p>
<p>on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience.</p>
<p>In the shift from party politics to television politics, the same goal is sought. We are not permitted to know who is best at being President or Governor or Senator, but whose image is best in touching and soothing the deep reaches of our discontent.</p>
<p>Those who would be gods refashion themselves into images the viewers would have them be.</p>
<p>just as the television commercial empties itself of authentic product information so that it can do its psychological work, image politics empties itself of authentic political substance for the same reason.</p>
<p>The Bill of Rights is largely a prescription for preventing government from restricting the flow of information and ideas. But the Founding Fathers did not foresee that tyranny by government might be superseded by another sort of problem altogether, namely, the corporate state, which through television now controls the flow of public discourse in America.</p>
<p>I would venture the opinion that the traditional civil libertarian opposition to the banning of books from school libraries and from school curricula is now largely irrelevant. Such acts of censorship are annoying, of course, and must be opposed. But they are trivial. Even worse, they are distracting, in that they divert civil libertarians from confronting those questions that have to do with the claims of new technologies. To put it plainly, a student’s freedom to read is not seriously injured by someone’s banning a book on Long Island or in Anaheim or anyplace else. But as Gerbner suggests, television clearly does impair the student’s freedom to read, and it does so with innocent hands, so to speak. Television does not ban books, it simply displaces them. The fight against censorship is a nineteenth-century issue which was largely won in the twentieth.
<strong>Note:</strong> of course now banning is back, but mostly symbolic for tv etc</p>
<p>Our Ministry of Culture is Huxleyan, not Orwellian. It does everything possible to encourage us to watch continuously. But what we watch is a medium which presents information in a form that renders it simplistic, nonsubstantive, nonhistorical and noncontextual;</p>
<h3 id="10-teaching-as-an-amusing-activity">10. Teaching as an Amusing Activity</h3>
<p>in doing away with the idea of sequence and continuity in education, television undermines the idea that sequence and continuity have anything to do with thought itself.</p>
<h3 id="11-the-huxleyan-warning">11. The Huxleyan Warning</h3>
<p>There are two ways by which the spirit of a culture may be shriveled. In the first—the Orwellian—culture becomes a prison. In the second—the Huxleyan—culture becomes a burlesque.</p>
<p>Of course, Orwell was not the first to teach us about the spiritual devastations of tyranny. What is irreplaceable about his work is his insistence that it makes little difference if our wardens are inspired by right- or left-wing ideologies. The gates of the prison are equally impenetrable, surveillance equally rigorous, icon-worship equally pervasive.</p>
<p>In the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours.</p>
<p>An Orwellian world is much easier to recognize, and to oppose, than a Huxleyan.</p>
<p>To be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple.</p>
<p>It is almost equally unrealistic to expect that nontrivial modifications in the availability of media will ever be made.</p>
<p>I am particularly fond of John Lindsay’s suggestion that political commercials be banned from television as we now ban cigarette and liquor commercials.</p>
<p>Television, as I have implied earlier, serves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse—news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion—and turns them into entertainment packages. We would all be better off if television got worse, not better. The A-Team and Cheers are no threat to our public health. 60 Minutes, Eye-Witness News and Sesame Street are.</p>
<p>The problem, in any case, does not reside in what people watch. The problem is in that we watch. The solution must be found in how we watch.</p>
<p>What I suggest here as a solution is what Aldous Huxley suggested, as well. And I can do no better than he. He believed with H. G. Wells that we are in a race between education and disaster, and he wrote continuously about the necessity of our understanding the politics and epistemology of media. For in the end, he was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in Brave New World was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.</p>

			 <p>🎶 Got to see <a href="https://www.americanarson.com/">American Arson</a> for the first time today. The duo was great and Evan Baker (singer/guitarist) seemed to be having a ton of fun and was gracious with the audience. They encouraged a singalong to &ldquo;<a href="https://youtu.be/rW0MMpv2tqU?si=NfiVn3NuucskdlbU">Hammer &amp; Gavel</a>&rdquo;, which I happily obliged.</p>
<p>Talked to Jesse Gentry (drummer) before the show. Got a non-black shirt (yay!). Also chatted about <a href="https://www.discogs.com/master/1724715-American-Arson-Rise-Fall">Rise &amp; Fall</a> which is their only release that one can&rsquo;t get right now, except as a cassette.

<p>He called this “prevalence-induced concept change.” Essentially “problem creep.” It explains that as we experience fewer problems, we don’t become more satisfied. We just lower our threshold for what we consider a problem. We end up with the same number of troubles. Except our new problems are progressively more hollow.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Call it comfort creep. When a new comfort is introduced, we adapt to it and our old comforts become unacceptable. Today’s comfort is tomorrow’s discomfort. This leads to a new level of what’s considered comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> But is this just hedonic adaption?</p>

<p>The state of sumikiri provided by misogi is why ancient students of aikido would immerse themselves in natural bodies of cold water. Waterfalls, streams, or the ocean would wash away their defilements and reconnect them with the universe. More recently, the idea of misogi has been applied to other forms of using epic challenges in nature to cleanse the defilements of the modern world.</p>
<p>Lapsing into flow requires two conditions: The task must stretch a person’s limits and it must have a clear goal. The flow state, Csikszentmihalyi and the other researchers now believe, is a key driver of happiness and growth.</p>
<p>Preventing kids from exploring their edges is largely thought to be the cause of the abnormally high and growing rates of anxiety and depression in young people.</p>
<p>By facing some challenge but not an overwhelming amount, these people developed an internal capacity that left them more robust and resilient.</p>

<p>along the way I took comfort in the fact that I am not alone. We all suck at new things. But clumsily exiting our comfort zones offers way too many upsides to ignore.</p>
<p>learning new skills is also one of the best ways to enhance awareness of the present moment,</p>
<p>Once we’ve done something over and over, our mind zones out of whatever old thing it’s doing.</p>
<p>In newness we’re forced into presence and focus. This is because we can’t anticipate what to expect and how to respond, breaking the trance that leads to life in fast forward. Newness can even slow down our sense of time. This explains why time seemed slower when we were kids. Everything was new then and we were constantly learning.</p>

<h3 id="101-miles">101 MILES</h3>
<p>Our general discomfort with solitude may be due to how society frames it. Consider how we discipline children: time-out. Or how we punish prisoners: solitary confinement. This tradition, Bowker thinks, may have cued us to believe that normalcy is found through others and that solitude is punishment.</p>
<p>Research backs solitude’s healthy properties. It’s been shown to improve productivity, creativity, empathy, and happiness, and decrease self-consciousness.</p>

<p>our collective lack of boredom is not only burning us out and leading to some ill mental health effects, but also muting what boredom is trying to tell us about our mind, emotions, ideas, wants, and needs.</p>
<p>Our brains essentially have two modes, focused and unfocused. Focused mode is a mind at attention. It’s on when we’re processing outside information, completing a task, checking our cellphone, watching TV, listening to a podcast, having a conversation, or anything else that requires us to attend to the outside world. Unfocused mode occurs when we’re not paying attention. It’s inward mind-wandering, a rest state that restores and rebuilds the resources needed to work better and more efficiently in the focused state. Time in unfocused mode is critical to get shit done, tap into creativity, process complicated information, and more.</p>
<p>Each time we reflexively take out our phone or turn on a computer or TV to kill boredom, it attaches another tiny anchor to our stress tolerance, dragging it lower. Scientists at Oregon State University found that daily stressors like lines and waits can improve our resistance to some brain diseases if we simply suffer through them and shrug them off. More of these everyday stressors are actually better for our brain.</p>
<p>And so, despite what productivity gurus will have us believe, the key to improving productivity and performance might be to occasionally do nothing at all. Or, at least, not dive into a screen. It prompts us to think distinctly, in a way that delivers more original ideas.</p>
<h3 id="20-minutes-5-hours-3-days">20 MINUTES, 5 HOURS, 3 DAYS</h3>
<p>They discovered that 20 minutes outside, three times a week, is the dose of nature that most efficiently dropped people’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The catch to that study, of course, was that the participants couldn’t take their phones outside with them.</p>
<p>In nature your brain enters a mode Hopman called “soft fascination.” It’s similar to unfocused mode—but with one key difference. “Instead of mind-wandering and lightly focusing inwardly, you’re lightly focusing outwardly on the nature around you,”</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Brain scans show that soft fascination is a lot like meditation. Hopman described it as a mindfulness-like state that restores and builds the resources we need to think, create, process information, and execute tasks.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes, three times a week, is great. But it’s at the bottom of what some nature scientists have dubbed “the nature pyramid.”</p>
<p>Time in this semiwild stuff comprises level two of the nature pyramid. Research, in part thanks to Finland, says we should spend a total of about five hours in it a month.</p>
<p>The rewilding of our body and brain usually goes something like this: On the first day stress and health markers improve, but we are still adjusting to the discomfort of nature. We’re thinking about how it sucks to be cold, missing our phone, and still focusing on the anxieties we left behind—what’s happening at work and whether we closed the garage door. By day two our mind is settling and awareness is heightening. We’re caring less about what we left behind and are beginning to notice the sights, smells, and sounds around us. Then day three hits. Now our senses are completely dialed in and we can reach a fully meditative mode of feeling connected to nature. The discomfort isn’t so bad. It has, in fact, shifted to a welcome sensation that signals a calmness and feeling of life satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="12-places">12 PLACES</h3>
<p>Our brains are wired to think loud = danger. We react by releasing adrenaline and cortisol, stress hormones that kick on the fight-or-flight response. Our doses of noise-induced stress hormones used to be infrequent but lifesaving. Today’s jarring background noises spur the same fight-or-flight response. But the difference is that these noises are nearly constant.</p>
<p>Gordon Hempton traveled the country in search of silence. He now believes that there are only 12 places in the Lower 48 where we can sit for 15 minutes and not hear a single noise created by humans. No droning planes, trains, automobiles. No blaring TVs, cellphones, or radios. Just natural soundscape. Some of these 12 places are spots in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Hawaii’s Haleakala National Park, and Washington’s Hoh River Valley. North America’s other consistently quiet places are way up north, where I am: Alaska, the Arctic, Yukon, Northwest Territories, etc.</p>

<p>The Japanese call this kuchisabishii, which literally means “lonely mouth” and describes our constant mindless eating.</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>
<p>Just 3 percent of the people who lose weight in a given year manage to keep it off. Their secret isn’t some special food or exercise no one else has. It’s their ability to get comfortable with discomfort.</p>
<p>Continuously trying to add more stuff on top of what you’re doing and constantly experimenting with shiny new things is almost never the answer. It just adds another layer of stress and complication. I believe people should be doing less and eliminating limiters to progress.</p>
<p>Each person tracked and reported:</p>
<p>• How much and what they ate. This involved weighing all the food the person ate to know true serving sizes and, therefore, calories.
• Their typical daily routine.
• Their sleep schedule.
• Their stress and energy levels.
• Their daily weight.
• Their workouts and step counts.</p>
<p>“I quickly ‘solved’ hundreds of problems just by virtue of improving a person’s awareness of their own behavior,” he said.</p>
<p>Once we eat, our brain releases dopamine, rewarding us for the behavior. This creates a circuit in the brain that associates food with dopamine.</p>
<p>Our brains evolved to release more dopamine when eating calorie-packed foods</p>
<p>The carb-fat combo doesn’t exist naturally, but it’s one that humans clamor for,</p>
<p>He recommended that I distract the discomfort of reward hunger with another form of discomfort: light exercise. “Find some ‘calorie negative’ ways of dealing with stress,” he said. “Walking is my number one. It relieves more stress and is health promoting. It leads you to burn calories rather than onboard them. And it removes you from the situation and adds time for reflection, where you can realize that you weren’t really hungry.”</p>
<p>Humans and other primates are uniquely predisposed to chronic stress. That’s because we’re smart, social creatures who have a lot of downtime to be “miserable to each other and stress each other out,” according to Robert Sapolsky,</p>
<p>The key quality that made a food filling: how heavy its 240-calorie serving size was.</p>
<h3 id="12-to-16-hours">12 TO 16 HOURS</h3>
<p>Rarely feeling real hunger is a strong sign that a person is suffering from the ill effects of comfort creep,</p>
<p>The data shows that we don’t typically gain weight in a linear fashion, like a quarter pound each month for a total of three pounds at the end of the year. Most of us maintain our weight most of the year, then experience periods of gain,</p>
<p>But it is agreed that these people weren’t eating around the clock. The research suggests they likely ate one or two meals a day.</p>
<p>Other research shows that programming two “hungry days” per week where we eat around 500 calories delivers benefits.</p>
<p>Another option is to string together five “hungry days” in a row, once a month, eating just 700 total calories.</p>

<p>some scholars have argued that American attempts to dematerialize are just another form of materialism.</p>
<p>It consists of “cramming our lives with compulsive activity, so that there is no time at all to confront the real issues….If we look into our lives, we will see clearly how many unimportant tasks, so-called ‘responsibilities’ accumulate to fill them up….Going on as we do, obsessively trying to improve our conditions, can become an end in itself and a pointless distraction.”</p>

<p>However, the best way to prevent ticks is by wearing an EPA registered insect repellent. For those who want to take it a step further, Green recommends treating clothes with the insecticide Permethrin, which can be put on clothes and, once it dries, is effective for several washings. Permethrin not only repels ticks but stuns them, so they just fall off of clothes.</p>

			 <p>🎶 I&rsquo;m slowly migrating my music to lossless (ALAC) by re-ripping our CDs, re-downloading bandcamp, and re-downloading better files from iTunes and Amazon (where available).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m carrying over my ratings from iTunes and Plex and then prioritizing listening to 5-start tracks and unrated items. It has me thinking about my rating system again. It&rsquo;s now something like:</p>
<p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: I want to hear this again soon</p>
<p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️: Happy to have this show up on a plalist, shuffle, DJ-mode, album, etc.</p>
<p>⭐️⭐️⭐️: Hrm, not sure if this is a good one for me</p>
<p>⭐️⭐️: I don&rsquo;t really want to hear this</p>
<p>⭐️: Why do I even own this?</p>
<p>Pictured is my &ldquo;shuffle&rdquo; playlist, to which I often apply &ldquo;DJ Stretch&rdquo; from <a href="https://www.plex.tv/plexamp/">PlexAmp</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guest DJ&rdquo; modes.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this organization and planning method for a few months and have found it both useful and flexible. It has just about the right blend of &ldquo;friction&rdquo; and &ldquo;flow&rdquo;, meaning that it is not so easy to use that it leads to overcommitment and overwhelm, nor so hard to use that I avoid it or feel overly slowed down.</p>
<p>The ability to easily restart (without losing anything) is a huge plus for those of us who feel the frequent temptation of starting over or trying new systems. The aforementioned sweet spot also helps prevent system switch.</p>
<p>The one thing I don&rsquo;t feel like it satisfactorily addresses is &ldquo;in which of my places is that Inbox, Project, Area, Resource, or Archive?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m tempted to make one storage location my &ldquo;main&rdquo; with some sort of index, but don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm the system. <em>How have you addressed this?</em></p>

<p>PROMISE #1: You will stop wasting time looking for information: You will know exactly where your most important notes and documents live, and how to find them in seconds.</p>
<p>PROMISE #2: You will gain greater focus on what matters most: You will have greater clarity about what’s important so you can intentionally move your life into alignment with your interests and goals.</p>
<p>PROMISE #3: You will make things happen: You will consistently finish what you start, beating procrastination and tapping into your past learning to make progress fast.</p>
<p>PROMISE #4: Your creativity and productivity will soar: You will have access to a playground of your own ideas to finally do the creative work that’s been locked up inside you.</p>
<p>PROMISE #5: You will beat information overload and FOMO: The fear of missing out on a key piece of information will disappear and be replaced with the confidence that you have everything you need to get started.</p>
<h2 id="part-1-the-fundamentals-of-para">PART 1 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PARA</h2>
<h3 id="1-introducing-para">1 Introducing PARA</h3>
<p>Such a system would need to be incredibly easy to set up, and even easier to maintain. After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term.
<em><strong>Note:</strong> yet there is value in friction re: recall and evaluation. How to manage this tension?</em></p>
<p>use it in every one of the many places where you store information.
<em><strong>Note:</strong> OK, but how do I know which one it lives in? (this does not get answered satisfactorily.)</em></p>
<p>Whether you want to save excerpts from a book you’re reading,
<em><strong>Note:</strong> Seems like overkill if you make a lot of highlights&hellip;but then again, maybe they should go in 04 Archive if they are not useful.</em></p>
<p>You have <strong>projects</strong> you’re actively working on—short-term efforts (whether in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p>You have areas of <strong>responsibility</strong>—important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention more broadly.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p>Then you have <strong>resources</strong> on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about,
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p>Finally, you have <strong>archives</strong>, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active but you might want to save for future reference:
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p>The system you use to organize information has to be so simple that it frees up your attention, instead of taking more of it. Your system must give you time, not take time.</p>
<h3 id="2-the-power-of-organizing-by-project">2 The Power of Organizing by Project</h3>
<p>there are two critical things you cannot do until you break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects.</p>
<p>OBSTACLE #1: You Can’t Truly Know the Extent of Your Commitments</p>
<p>OBSTACLE #2: You Can’t Connect Your Current Efforts to Your Long-Term Goals</p>
<p>What does our motivation depend on? Mostly, on making consistent progress. We can endure quite a bit of stress and frustration in the short term if we know it’s leading somewhere.</p>
<p>without a list of individual projects, you can’t connect your current efforts to your long-term goals.</p>
<p>When you break down your responsibilities into bite-size projects, you ensure that your project list is constantly turning over. This turnover creates a cadence of regular victories that you get to celebrate every time you successfully complete a project.</p>
<p>Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go. It is about organizing information in such a way that it supports and calls into being the future life you want to lead.</p>

<p>Step 1: Archive existing files
Step 2: Create project folders
Step 3: Create additional folders as needed</p>
<h4 id="step-1-archive-existing-files">STEP 1: Archive Existing Files</h4>
<p>The problem with keeping everything is that it quickly starts to consume a resource even more scarce than physical space: your attention.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite</em></p>
<p>select all the existing files, documents, folders, notes, etc. in your Documents folder (which may number in the hundreds or even thousands or more) and move them all at once into a new folder called “Archive [Today’s date].”</p>
<p>Then, place this new dated archive folder inside another, larger folder titled simply “Archives,” which will be the official home of all your archives going forward.</p>
<h4 id="step-2-create-project-folders">STEP 2: Create Project Folders</h4>
<p>For the second step, start by creating a new folder called “Projects.” This will be the official home of all your information related to projects (short-term efforts with a clear end goal) going forward. Inside that new folder, create a subfolder for each one of your active projects and title them with the name of each project.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-create-additional-folders-as-needed">STEP 3: Create Additional Folders as Needed</h4>
<p>never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it.</p>
<p>follow the same three steps above with your cloud storage drive, notetaking app, and anywhere else you store information,
<em><strong>Note:</strong> email, paper, photos, screenshots?</em></p>
<p>Think carefully about what you want to save in all four categories of PARA. What is truly unique or useful? What do you need in front of you when you sit down to focus on a project or area? Which resources are truly valuable, and which could you easily find again with a Google search?

<h3 id="4-five-key-tips-for-making-organizing-easy">4 Five Key Tips for Making Organizing Easy</h3>
<h4 id="tip-1-create-an-inbox">TIP #1: Create an Inbox</h4>
<p>you need a separate time and place to “process” new items. I recommend creating an additional, fifth folder alongside the four we’ve already covered, on each major platform you use (such as your Documents folder, cloud storage drive, and notetaking app) with the title “Inbox.”</p>
<h4 id="tip-2-number-the-folders">TIP #2: Number the Folders</h4>
<p>I suggest adding the numbers 0–4 at the beginning of the titles for each of the five folders you now have. Using “0” for the inbox reminds you that its contents have not yet been processed. This keeps them in the right order from most to least actionable when they are sorted alphabetically.</p>
<h4 id="tip-3-use-a-naming-convention">TIP #3: Use a Naming Convention</h4>
<p>It’s helpful if you can see a folder—on any platform, on any device—and instantly know which of the four main PARA categories it is in. I like to use an informal naming convention to make this possible, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders</li>
<li>Capitalized titles for area folders</li>
<li>Uncapitalized titles for resource folders</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tip-4-activate-offline-mode">TIP #4: Activate Offline Mode</h4>
<p>activate offline mode for just the Projects folder (and its subfolders) on each device you use while traveling, in transit, or when you just want to shut off the Wi-Fi and focus.</p>
<h4 id="tip-5-make-backups">TIP #5: Make Backups</h4>
<h3 id="5-how-to-maintain-your-para-system">5 How to Maintain Your PARA System</h3>
<p>do all the upkeep of your PARA system in just five minutes per week. All you need to do is follow these three easy steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retitle new items in your inbox</li>
<li>Sort new items into PARA folders</li>
<li>Update your active projects</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-1-retitle-new-items-in-your-inbox">STEP #1: Retitle New Items in Your Inbox</h4>
<p>giving each item the shortest, simplest, easiest-to-understand title I can think of within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Note that you likely have several inboxes you’ll need to do this for, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>An inbox you’ve created in your Documents folder (recommended in chapter 4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inbox for your cloud storage drive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An inbox in your digital notetaking app</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> email, paper, photos, screenshots?</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="step-2-sort-new-items-into-para-folders">STEP #2: Sort New Items into PARA Folders</h4>
<p>I also find that briefly revisiting new information I’ve captured over the last week serves as a helpful reminder of any follow-up actions I need to take.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-update-your-active-projects">STEP #3: Update Your Active Projects</h4>
<p>take a look at your project folders and make changes to reflect what’s happened over the past week. This could include actions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changing the name of a project to reflect a new scope or direction</li>
<li>Splitting a large project into smaller ones to make it more achievable</li>
<li>Archiving a project that has been completed, put on hold, canceled, or handed over to someone else</li>
<li>Unarchiving a dormant project that has since become active again and moving it back to the Projects folder</li>
</ul>
<p>Before archiving a project, scan it briefly for any material (such as brainstorms, background research, slides, interview notes, etc.) that might be relevant to other pursuits and move these items to the appropriate place within PARA.</p>
<p>The Archive should be your starting point any time you launch a new project, do a personal year-end review, or update your résumé for a new job. It contains the supporting evidence you’ll need to successfully advocate for a raise or promotion, pitch a new client, or propose a bold new venture.</p>
<h2 id="part-2-the-para-playbook">PART 2 THE PARA PLAYBOOK</h2>
<h3 id="6-how-to-distinguish-between-projects-and-areas">6 How to Distinguish between Projects and Areas</h3>
<p>My definition of a <strong>project</strong> is any endeavor that has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A goal that will enable you to mark it “complete”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done</p>
<p><em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An <strong>area</strong> of responsibility has:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A standard to be maintained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An indefinite end date</p>
<p><em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You also have areas of responsibility in your personal life, like your health, finances, personal development, and relationships,</p>
<p>To put it simply: projects end, while areas continue indefinitely.
<em><strong>Note:</strong> it seems the project goal/date and area standards should be uniformly included somewhere in the system. 0 file? Title?</em></p>
<p>Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility.</p>
<p>I’ve noticed most people tend to favor either projects or areas in the way they lead their lives. &hellip; Once you view your life through the lens of projects and areas, it becomes very clear that you need both: sprints to ramp up something new, and marathons to sustain it.</p>
<h3 id="7-how-to-distinguish-between-areas-and-resources">7 How to Distinguish between Areas and Resources</h3>
<p>there is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in. I use uppercase titles for areas and lowercase titles for resources to constantly remind myself that one is more important than the other.</p>
<p><strong>Areas</strong> are parts of our lives that require ongoing attention to uphold a certain level of quality or performance. It’s helpful to think of them as the “roles you play” or the “hats you wear” at work and in life.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p><strong>Resources</strong> encompass the vast number of things you might be interested in, curious about, or passionate about at any given time.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<p>Instead of asking, “Is this interesting?” which always results in overcollecting, I ask myself, <strong>“Is this useful?”</strong> That’s a much higher bar and forces me to consider what this piece of information will allow me to do that I couldn’t do otherwise, which problem it could help me solve, or which obstacle it might help me overcome.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite</em></p>
<p>Areas Are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable</p>
<p>Therefore, I recommend you think of your resource folders as “shareable by default.” That way you can share individual documents (or even entire folders) with others on the fly, without first having to comb through them for any personal details.
<em><strong>Note:</strong> these should go in a different place, then, where they cannot be accidentally shared (via backlinks, etc.)</em></p>
<p>We’ve all done it—some area of our lives feels too complex, uncertain, or confronting, so we throw ourselves at something else to take our mind off it. It feels great at first, distracting ourselves from pressing problems in favor of an exciting new hobby or research interest.</p>
<h3 id="8-extending-para-across-multiple-platforms">8 Extending PARA across Multiple Platforms</h3>
<p>Technology is advancing too quickly on too many fronts for any one app to fulfill every need. Instead of fighting the tide and looking for “one app to rule them all,” use as many apps as you like, while replicating the same structure across every single one. I recommend doing so down to the exact same spelling, punctuation, and capitalization so that you can mentally transition between platforms as seamlessly as possible.</p>
<p>I use the following rules of thumb to tell me which digital storage medium is best for any given piece of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it’s an appointment or meeting happening at a specific time, it goes on my calendar</li>
<li>If it’s a task that I can complete anytime, it goes in my to-do list app</li>
<li>If it’s text, it goes in my notetaking app (since that offers the best search function by which to find it again)</li>
<li>If it’s content that I’ll be collaborating on with others, it goes in my cloud storage drive</li>
<li>If it can’t go in any of the above locations (because it’s too large or a specialized file type, for example), then it goes in my computer’s file system (the Documents folder)</li>
</ul>
<p>you should create a folder on any platform only when you have something to put in it.</p>
<p>The landscape of productivity software is always changing, but that doesn’t mean your organizing methods have to be. If a feature you depend on stops working, or the policies or pricing of a platform unexpectedly change, that affects only one platform. With PARA, any risk or vulnerability is limited to just one part of your digital life and doesn’t automatically knock out all the others.</p>
<h3 id="9-keep-information-flowing">9 Keep Information Flowing</h3>
<p>One final note: though my preferred method is to move notes and files wholesale from one place to another, you actually have four options for how to associate an existing piece of information with a new category:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moving a single item (if only one item is relevant to a new project, for example)</li>
<li>Moving a folder full of items (if a whole group of items is relevant)</li>
<li>Linking two items together (if you want to keep the original item where it is)</li>
<li>Tagging items with the same tag (if you want to associate many items with each other without moving them)</li>
</ul>
<p>The only action I recommend avoiding at all costs is duplication: you never want to have two versions of a file or document, because then you never know which one is the most current.</p>
<h3 id="10-using-para-with-a-team">10 Using PARA with a Team</h3>
<p>It takes a lot of time and effort to articulate one’s knowledge in a form that can be understood by others. Since most staff aren’t compensated or evaluated for that effort, it always tends to fall by the wayside.</p>
<h4 id="recommendation-1-get-clear-on-your-organizations-flavor-of-para">RECOMMENDATION #1: Get clear on your organization’s flavor of PARA</h4>
<p>I suggest creating a “PARA Playbook” for your team that includes decisions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is our definition of a “project,” “area of responsibility,” “resource,” and “archive”?</li>
<li>What needs to happen when we kick off a new project for it to be considered “active”?</li>
<li>What needs to happen when a project gets completed, put on hold, or canceled (to be considered “inactive”)?</li>
<li>What are the officially supported platforms on which PARA will be used?</li>
<li>What are the rules, guidelines, and norms that govern how people will use PARA?</li>
<li>Who will be the “PARA Champion” who oversees its implementation and makes sure the guidelines are being followed?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="recommendation-2-train-people-in-how-to-use-para">RECOMMENDATION #2: Train people in how to use PARA</h4>
<p>you will need to teach your people not only how PARA works, but how it works for your team.</p>
<h4 id="recommendation-3-keep-only-shared-projects-on-shared-platforms">RECOMMENDATION #3: Keep only shared projects on shared platforms</h4>
<p>it takes a tremendous amount of cognitive effort to effectively communicate a piece of knowledge.</p>
<p>I recommend advising your team to keep all their personal notes, files, and documents in their personal PARA system by default. Only when a project, area, or resource becomes collaborative, with multiple people involved, should it be moved to the shared folders in a company-wide PARA system.</p>
<h4 id="recommendation-4-encourage-a-culture-of-writing">RECOMMENDATION #4: Encourage a culture of writing</h4>
<p>A high-quality piece of communication meets the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Is it interesting and attention-grabbing? (Does it make people want to read it?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it precise and clear? (Can people easily understand what it’s trying to say?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is it empathetic? (Is it written to be understood from the reader’s point of view?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it help people solve a problem? (Is it clearly useful and effective?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does it inspire people to take action? (Does it make it easy for others to apply it?)</p>
<p><em><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Set an example: Senior leadership and managers can set an example by regularly sharing their most important ideas and decisions in writing</p>
<p>Offer incentives: Staff at all levels can be rewarded and praised when they take the time to express their thinking in writing</p>
<p>Provide feedback: Direct reports can be offered private feedback on their writing drafts before sharing them more widely</p>
<p>Set aside time for reading: Meetings can begin with “reading time” to emphasize that the context for discussions is best absorbed in written form</p>
<p>Standardize: Adopt a standard term for an internal piece of writing (such as a memo, proposal, one-pager, or article) and create a standard template (such as a Google Doc or Notion page) for doing so</p>
<h2 id="part-3-deep-dives">PART 3 DEEP DIVES</h2>
<h3 id="11-creating-a-project-list">11 Creating a Project List</h3>
<p>Your <strong>Project</strong> List is a list of the outcomes you are currently committed to achieving, all in one place. It is an inventory of all the things you’re trying to produce, create, accomplish, or resolve. It’s like a to-do list, but on a bigger scale and longer time horizon so you can tell where you’re headed. It’s like a list of goals, but more practical and rooted in the here and now.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>
<h4 id="step-1-list-your-current-projects">STEP #1: List Your Current Projects</h4>
<p>Set a timer for five minutes (which is enough for a “first pass”) and write down anything that comes to mind when you read the following questions, whether they are work-related or personal:</p>
<p>What’s currently worrying you? What problem is taking more mental bandwidth than it deserves? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on? What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with? Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start? What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting?
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<h4 id="step-2-add-a-goal-for-each-project">STEP #2: Add a Goal for Each Project</h4>
<p>Take a minute and add a goal for each project on your list in parentheses.</p>
<h4 id="step-3-add-deadlines-or-timeframes">STEP #3: Add Deadlines or Timeframes</h4>
<p>Next, go through the list one more time and add completion dates. Don’t get hung up on whether this is a strict “deadline” or simply the date by which you prefer to have it done. You can add dates to each item on your list by adding “by…” at the end.</p>
<h4 id="step-4-prioritize-your-list">STEP #4: Prioritize Your List</h4>
<p>The key here is to prioritize only for the upcoming week.</p>
<p>For just next week, which projects should be taking up most of your mental bandwidth? Put those at the top. Which ones should be taking up little or none of your bandwidth next week? Put those at the bottom.
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<p>Your only goal in a given week is to make progress on a handful of projects near the top of that list.</p>
<h4 id="step-5-reevaluate-your-project-list">STEP #5: Reevaluate Your Project List</h4>
<p>Now that you have a full inventory of everything you’re committed to this week, you have the chance to ask some difficult but incredibly illuminating questions of yourself:</p>
<p>Which goals or priorities you say are important to you don’t have any projects associated with them? (These are called “dreams,” since they aren’t likely to happen in the near term.) Which projects you’re spending a lot of time on don’t have any goals associated with them? (These are called “hobbies,” because without a goal in mind, they are likely “just for fun.”) Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify?
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<p>The five steps I’ve just taken you through can become part of a “weekly review.” You can walk through them once a week, or anytime you feel overwhelmed or stretched too thin, and I guarantee you’ll emerge in minutes with a newfound sense of clarity and purpose.</p>
<h3 id="12-the-three-core-habits-of-organization">12 The Three Core Habits of Organization</h3>
<p>We know our memories are weak, so we outsource remembering to technology as insurance against that fact.</p>
<p>The only thing that will remain is the habits you adopt or change</p>
<h4 id="habit-1-organize-according-to-outcomes">HABIT #1: Organize According to Outcomes</h4>
<p>always begin with the end in mind and work backward to decide only which information you’ll need to get there, and push everything else aside.</p>
<h4 id="habit-2-organize-just-in-time">HABIT #2: Organize Just in Time</h4>
<p>organizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action.</p>
<h4 id="habit-3-keep-things-informal">HABIT #3: Keep Things Informal</h4>
<p>PARA requires precision in only one place: the definition of projects. Everything else is not only allowed to remain somewhat messy;</p>
<p>Allowing some messiness and randomness into the system creates opportunities for very different ideas to be connected and intermixed.</p>
<p>Organizing ideas according to outcomes ensures you’re actively testing them in the real world. Organizing just in time preserves your time and energy so you can pursue unexpected opportunities. And keeping things informal by default allows novel connections and patterns to form.</p>
<h3 id="13-using-para-to-enhance-focus-creativity-and-perspective">13 Using PARA to Enhance Focus, Creativity, and Perspective</h3>
<p>Collecting information is easy, and we’ve seen that filing it away isn’t that hard either. But if you stop there, all this effort amounts to hoarding. Value doesn’t come from the inputs; it comes from your outputs, bearing your signature and style.</p>
<p>It’s helpful to think of each main category of PARA as a “horizon.” Your projects exist on a short-term horizon that will play out in the coming hours or days. Your areas of responsibility and resources play out on a medium-term horizon over weeks and months. Your archives are more likely to be useful on a long-term horizon of months or years.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of questions that are relevant on this short-term horizon: Which projects are most active right now? Which tasks are most time-sensitive? What are the next steps you need to take to move them forward? What information do you need access to in order to do so?
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<p>At these times of deeper reflection, ask yourself these questions: What is the standard (of quality or performance) I’m committed to in each of my areas of responsibility? Am I currently meeting that standard? If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, or other practices I can start, stop, or change? Are there any resources that would enable me to do so?
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<p>When evaluating your resources, ask yourself questions like: Are there any new interests or passions I’d like to pursue more seriously? Are there any curiosities or questions I’d like to start exploring? Are there any hobbies or pursuits I’ve allowed to stagnate that I’d like to reboot?
<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>
<h3 id="14-when-in-doubt-start-over">14 When in Doubt, Start Over</h3>
<p>If you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, simply archive everything and start over following the instructions I provided in chapter 3.</p>
<p>the act of declaring “digital bankruptcy” is an escape hatch that you can use anytime your digital world starts to become too chaotic and suffocating. I’ve done it countless times, and every time it fills me with a sense of relief and enthusiasm for what’s next.</p>
<p>When it comes to your finances, there are serious consequences to declaring bankruptcy. But not in the digital world. There is no downside to archiving everything because it will all remain available in the future.</p>
<h3 id="15-organizing-as-personal-growth">15 Organizing as Personal Growth</h3>
<p>By surrounding yourself with information that provokes a feeling of fascination, you’ll begin to harness the incredible enthusiasm for learning and growth you have trapped inside.</p>
<p>Power comes from systems that don’t depend on your energy levels, attention span, or self-discipline. That’s why PARA asks you to make one decision for each piece of information, and one decision only: When will this be relevant next?</p>
<p>Don’t create a bunch of aspirational projects and goals that are merely wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Even when it comes to lesser threats, the bottom line is that we have untold trillions of dollars riding on top of code developed by hobbyists.

<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions">In the Midst of Lions</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions/The+Heart+of+Man">The Heart of Man</a>: I listened to this over and over when I commuted downtown 1 or 2 times a week. You can still catch me or my spouse belting out an epic growl of &ldquo;Brood of Vipers!&rdquo; from <em>The Pharisaic Heart</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today">For Today</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today/Breaker">Breaker</a>: Energetic &amp; hard-hitting without a dud on the entire album.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada">The Crimson Armada</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada/Conviction">Conviction</a>: Technical deathcore with choruses that beg you to sing along.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red">August Burns Red</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/Constellations">Constellations</a>: This was the album that got me hooked on ABR.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note">Broken Note</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note/Terminal+Static">Terminal Static</a>: Grimy industrial dubs. One of many groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zao">Zao</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Zao/Where+Blood+and+Fire+Bring+Rest">Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest</a>: Not only one of my top-listened albums, but surely one of the best, as well. Incredible genre-defining metalcore. I even have the album cover as art.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katatonia">Katatonia</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Katatonia/Dethroned+&amp;+Uncrowned">Dethroned &amp; Uncrowned</a>: The clever title for this soft<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> version of their <em>Dead End Kings</em> album alone makes it worth a listen, but I find myself melancholically singing along to almost every track.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Hidden">DJ Hidden</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Hidden/The+Later+After">The Later After</a>: Threatening atmospheric drum &amp; bass, darkstep. Another of the groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Celldweller">Celldweller</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Celldweller/Wish+Upon+A+Blackstar">Wish Upon A Blackstar</a>: This is the moment Klayton hit his stride in creating albums as complete concepts.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flesh+Field">Flesh Field</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flesh+Field/Strain">Strain</a>: To me, this is the most iconic sound of the &ldquo;core&rdquo; of industrial music. I really appreciate the drums, programming, and contrasting voices in this album.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Edit</em>: I made a glaring omission! The next album would have come in #3 if I had included the different editions as one.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle+Park" title="Argyle Park">Argyle Park</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle+Park/Misguided+(Remastered)+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D" title="Misguided (Remastered) [Deluxe Edition]">Misguided</a>: this was a super-controversial, way-ahead-of-its time album. It included people from Klayton&rsquo;s musical circles, including his common collaborators (lvl, buka, Klank); Mark Salomon (of Stavesacre, the Crucified, Chatterbox, etc.); and others in the scene like Jyro (Mortal), J.G. Thirlwell (Foetus), Tommy Victor (Prong), and Lauren Boquette (Drown, Six). It&rsquo;s a one-of-a-kind album.</p>

<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions">In the Midst of Lions</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions/_/The+Machine">The Machine</a>: I dare you to listen to this an never let out your own &ldquo;stop&hellip;the machine!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today">For Today</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today/_/Devastator">Devastator</a>: Same as above, but with &ldquo;tear it to the ground!&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Igorrr">Igorrr</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Igorrr/_/Double+Monk">Double Monk</a>: This was one of those songs that threatened my understanding of a what a &ldquo;song&rdquo; could be (Igorrr has a way of doing that). This is one of those few songs that I&rsquo;ve put on a single-song loop. Also, from another of the groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada">The Crimson Armada</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada/_/Juggernaut">Juggernaut</a>: I love all the contrasting vocal and instrumental elements that make the story of this song work so well. &ldquo;You can rip out my tongue / And I&rsquo;ll speak of His love. / You can pry out my eyes / And I&rsquo;ll show off His love  / You can tear off my flesh / I&rsquo;ll share the warmth of his love&rdquo;.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red">August Burns Red</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/_/White+Washed">White Washed</a>: I just love the sound of this one, honestly. (I think it may be about an argument between them and a straightedge band.)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note">Broken Note</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note/_/Mask+of+Gas">Mask of Gas</a>: this track feels like a industrial warehouse dance-off with electronic and hip-hop groups.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Living+Sacrifice">Living Sacrifice</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Living+Sacrifice/_/Bloodwork">Bloodwork</a>: this is from my favorite era of LS. Two percussionists. The guitars were percussion. The vocals were percussion. Everything was percussion! What a fun track and album.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drumcorps">Drumcorps</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Drumcorps/_/Down">Down</a>: Like Igorrr&rsquo;s track above, this was one of those songs that threatened my understanding of a what a &ldquo;song&rdquo; could be (and is yet another from a groundbreaking breakcore-ish album from the Ad Noiseam label).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haste+The+Day">Haste The Day</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Haste+The+Day/_/When+Everything+Falls">When Everything Falls</a>: remember when I said that this metalcore band had some boppy anthems? (also, it&rsquo;s a great way to end a show/concert/festival. <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/09/24/perfect-ending-to.html">e.g.</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flobots">Flobots</a> - <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Flobots/_/Stand+Up">Stand Up</a>: This was one of the tracks that introduced me to the social, lyrical, and musical depth of Flobots.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A policeman sees a drunk man searching for something under a streetlight and asks what the drunk has lost. He says he lost his keys and they both look under the streetlight together. After a few minutes the policeman asks if he is sure he lost them here, and the drunk replies, no, and that he lost them in the park. The policeman asks why he is searching here, and the drunk replies, &ldquo;this is where the light is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This metaphor has intriguing applications in various domains, but I’ve repeatedly encountered this phenomenon in <strong>technology</strong> and <strong>cybersecurity</strong>. A common pattern I observe goes like this:</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m deeply concerned about <em>X</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>B: &ldquo;<em>X</em> is indeed a problem, but is it our <strong>most significant problem</strong>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;Yes, we encounter it all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B: &ldquo;<em>Y</em> is a similar problem to <em>X</em>, but we lack sufficient visibility into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A: &ldquo;But we often see <em>X</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>B: &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting you shouldn&rsquo;t go after quick wins. (<em>Creating momentum is often important.</em>)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also not suggesting you wait until you have complete knowledge before you take action. (<em>That can lead to analysis paralysis.</em>)</p>
<p>But I am saying to <strong>check whether your perspective is being skewed by your current visibility</strong>.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>This is a post is in the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/">Useful Ideas</a> series.</em></p>
<p>People sometimes say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy to criticize&rdquo; but how easy is it to <strong>criticize well</strong>?</p>
<p>Many of us often find ourselves in situations where we are called on to be critical. As a cybersecurity and product security leader, this is one of my core job duties! So, I thought I&rsquo;d share some of the lessons I&rsquo;ve learned (<em>often, the hard way!</em>) about criticism.</p>
<h3 id="criticism-is-not-the-same-thing-as-feedback">Criticism is not the same thing as feedback</h3>
<p>While it&rsquo;s tempting to think all the same rules apply, there are some different aspects to consider. I&rsquo;ll write about giving useful feedback in <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/">a different post</a>. <strong>If you&rsquo;re in a mindset of giving constructive feedback, consider reading that commentary instead.</strong></p>
<h3 id="criticism-is-not-about-blaming">Criticism is not about blaming</h3>
<p>Finger-pointing is rarely helpful. Good criticism seeks to get to the heart of the matter, so it often involves considering the context of the situation, the processes/structures/systems that produced the outcome, and the variety of factors that contributed. <strong>If you find yourself wanting to blame someone, check your motivations.</strong></p>
<h3 id="criticism-is-not-for-its-own-sake">Criticism is not for it&rsquo;s own sake</h3>
<p>If the criticism isn&rsquo;t leading to learning or change, then it is not valuable. If you are not prepared to help with that learning or change (<em>whether through recommendations, support, or addressing a problem</em>), it is not valuable. If it is not delivered to the people that are best positioned do something about it, then it is not valuable. If it is not delivered in a context and setting where the audience is receptive, then it is not valuable. <strong>If you are not trying to drive a good outcome, check your motivations.</strong></p>
<p><em>Good criticism is difficult, and a lot more could be written here, but I hope these warnings will help you learn from some of my own experience giving it.</em></p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>I usually use <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams">last.fm</a> to look at my top artists by <strong>number of plays</strong>. Today, I decided to look at <strong>who have the most ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ tracks</strong> in my library. It came out like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Circle of Dust</li>
<li>Between the Buried and Me</li>
<li>August Burns Red</li>
<li>Black Sun Empire</li>
<li>Clubroot</li>
<li>Underoath</li>
<li>Living Sacrifice</li>
<li>Kardashev</li>
<li>Opeth</li>
<li>Brainchild (tie)</li>
<li>Front Line Assembly (tie)</li>
</ol>
<p>A couple of these are in my all-time top-listened artists (August Burns Red, Front Line Assembly) but many of them aren&rsquo;t. Some of that is because my top-listened artists have great <em>albums</em> that get a lot of plays. Others (like BtBaM and Opeth) might not be at the top because their songs are so long and account for fewer plays per time listened. Others (Kardashev) are newer to me.</p>
<p>Also, as usual, Rhys Fulber and Klayton would rocket off the top of charts if each stuck to one project name. Klayton (already at #1, #10, and remixer of some of #7) would be even higher if I threw in Argyle Park, AP2, Celldweller, and early work with Klank. Rhys Fulber (#11) would be in second place if we included self-titled work, Fear Factory mixes &amp; remixes, and Noise Unit.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll revisit this view again after I get more tracks in my library rated.</p>
<p>Who hold the most 5-star tracks in your library?</p>

<p>I like a lot of strange music (see picture), but what I don&rsquo;t care for is the &ldquo;<strong>wall of fuzz</strong>&rdquo; sound that a lot of black metal makes. It&rsquo;s uninteresting and tiresome.</p>
<p>The ones I do enjoy have a little something extra going on.</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2024/01/10/three-directions-of.html">Three Directions of Org Design</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2024/01/10/three-directions-of.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2024-01-10 15:45:47 -0400">Jan 10, 2024</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>This is a post is in the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/">Useful Ideas</a> series.</em></p>
<p>This is a framework to guide organizational design decisions, based on three directions: <em>inside-out</em>, <em>outside-in</em>, and <em>upwards</em>. Most of us tend to primarily consider one of these directions, so  this framework helps us to evaluate the <em>other</em> directions, as well.</p>
<p>As you evaluate these factors, there will be tradeoffs to make, but considering each of these directions helps you to make <strong>informed</strong> tradeoffs and to <strong>mitigate</strong> the downsides of your approach.</p>
<p>For each direction, I&rsquo;ll give a brief glimpse of an org design that highly prioritizes that perspective often at the expense of the other perspectives.</p>
<p><em>Note: I believe these principles are relevant to many types of organizations. However, I chose to use consistent and simplified language where possible. So, when you see &ldquo;customers&rdquo;, for example, you may need to mentally substitute this with &ldquo;stakeholders&rdquo;, &ldquo;boundary partners&rdquo;, &ldquo;constituents&rdquo;, &ldquo;members&rdquo;, &ldquo;clients&rdquo; or whatever is the appropriate term for the type of organization you are designing. Do this for other terms, as well.</em></p>
<h2 id="inside-out-delivery">Inside-Out: Delivery</h2>
<p>The inside-out direction focuses on how a team is aligned for delivery. It considers questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it easy to get quality output &amp; results through the system?</li>
<li>Have we limited dependencies so that there are reduced handoffs and waiting?</li>
<li>Do we have all the needed skills and competencies within the team?</li>
<li>Are roles and responsibilities clear?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Extreme example: the team is fully self-contained and has a highly-structured production line.</em></p>
<p>The inside-out direction is about creating a structure that supports the execution of the  strategy and the delivery of value to the customers.</p>
<h2 id="outside-in-customers">Outside-In: Customers</h2>
<p>The outside-in direction focuses on how customers engage with the organization. It considers questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it easy for customers to get support?</li>
<li>Do customers know where to go for support, and are there limited places to go?</li>
<li>Are we building rapport and trust with customers?</li>
<li>Are we aligned to anticipate and respond to customer needs and expectations?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Extreme example: each customer has a personal ambassador to the organization who is fully equipped and empowered to address the customer&rsquo;s needs.</em></p>
<p>The outside-in direction is about creating a customer-centric culture and a customer-oriented structure.</p>
<h2 id="upwards-expertise">Upwards: Expertise</h2>
<p>The upwards direction focuses on how team members gain domain knowledge, skill, and ability to troubleshoot. It considers questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do people responsible for delivery get significant exposure to problems?</li>
<li>&hellip;and are they incentivized to understand and solve them?</li>
<li>Do team members get practice &amp; timely feedback that hones their skill &amp; knowledge?</li>
<li>Are we helping people become adept at their craft and greater in wisdom?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Extreme example: for every offering, team member(s) are responsible for the complete lifecycle from initial design to ongoing support.</em></p>
<p>The upwards direction is about creating a growth-oriented culture and a people-oriented structure.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Each direction represents a different perspective on how to align the structure, roles, and competencies of the organization with its strategy, culture, environment, customers, and people. The framework helps to evaluate the tradeoffs and benefits of each direction, and to create a balanced and effective organization.</p>

			 <p><em>This is a post is in the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/">Useful Ideas</a> series.</em></p>
<p>When discussing contributions, it&rsquo;s often important to address both the <em>me</em> <strong>and</strong> the <em>we</em>.</p>
<p>This can apply in many situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>both <em>accomplishments</em> &amp; <em>problems</em></li>
<li>both <em>personal</em> &amp; <em>professional</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Addressing both the &ldquo;me&rdquo; and the &ldquo;we&rdquo; is important not just because the personal and the collective are <strong>both important</strong>, but also because of the <strong>systems and relationships between them</strong> are important.</p>
<p><em>Example</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I interview someone and they focus on what their group accomplished, I don&rsquo;t get a useful understanding of their capabilities &amp; skills. When I interview someone and they focus on what they personally accomplished, I wonder if they work well with others. When I interview someone who addresses both, I can better understand the whole picture of the environment they were working in and how they made an impact in that environment.</li>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m in the process of re-building my Plex ecosystem. In the interim, I&rsquo;ve either been listening to straight albums or playing from my iTunes library using this structure:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h1 id="what-this-means">What this means&hellip;</h1>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Un&rdquo;</strong> is a folder of four auto-updating smart playlists. I shuffle the whole thing to listen (and of course, scrobble to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams">last.fm</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Un 2023&rdquo;</strong> contains all tracks released this year that have neither been listened to nor skipped</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Unloved&rdquo;</strong> contains all non-holiday 5-star/loved/favorited songs that  haven&rsquo;t been played in the last year</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Unskipped&rdquo;</strong> is a little more inclusive version of <em>unloved</em>, but limited to 1 GB of music (chosen by recently added): all non-holiday unskipped, undisliked songs not played in the last year</li>
<li><strong>&ldquo;Untouched&rdquo;</strong> is a little more inclusive version of <em>un 2023</em>, but limited to 1 GB of music (chosen by recently added): all non-holiday songs that haven&rsquo;t been listened to, skipped, or rated</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-it-creates">What it creates&hellip;</h1>
<p>Overall, this is a mixture weighted toward top songs along with some &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of recent music and recent adds to my library. It works very well with limited &ldquo;management&rdquo; of the music.</p>

<p>What he and his colleagues found was that corals had a temperature threshold. Once those temperatures are breached, the corals start to expel the tiny algae that live inside them and give corals their colour and much of their nutrients.</p>

<p>Rather than having a century or more, the models suggested as early as the 2020s some reefs could be bleaching six or more times a decade – a frequency far too high to give them time to recover.</p>

<p>Swiss-German Mennonites did not pull themselves up by their bootstraps when they came to North America.
Many 18th-century families had help from the Dutch Mennonites, who financed early immigration to Pennsylvania.
Mennonites in Amsterdam also sent aid to poor and persecuted Anabaptist families in Switzerland and the Palatine region of Germany.
Their descendants — especially those in Plain Anabaptist communities — don’t want this legacy of mutual aid to be forgotten.</p>

			 <p>Day 2 of reflecting on <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/11/11/i-recently-shared.html">this saga</a>, and I&rsquo;m thinking a lot about <strong>trust</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I lost <strong>trust</strong> that the positive recommendations were being acted on. Why? I saw no evidence of improvement in the situation, and no evidence of accountability for changes.</li>
<li>They didn&rsquo;t <strong>trust</strong> me enough to talk about what they were or weren&rsquo;t trying from the recommendations lists (if anything), or how it was going (which would have prevented me from losing <strong>trust</strong>).</li>
<li>They didn&rsquo;t <strong>trust</strong> that I was acting with good intent. Why? I don&rsquo;t know for sure, but I think because I got more frustrated the longer that improvements didn&rsquo;t happen, and they took that to mean I actually always wanted a different course of action.</li>
<li>Yet, they do seem to <strong>trust</strong> (<em>or at least allow-to-continue, to my first point</em>) some folks who  frequently feed cover-ups, FUD, and mischaracterizations to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m thinking more about: <strong>&ldquo;how much of this is their judgment?&rdquo;</strong> and <strong>&ldquo;how much of this is my approach?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a hard thing to suss out, but if you have methods you&rsquo;ve used to evaluate those sorts of things, I&rsquo;d be glad to hear them.</p>

			 <p>I recently shared another one of my operating principles: <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/11/03/the-best-way.html">&ldquo;The best way to <strong>look</strong> good is to <strong>do</strong> good&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>I have a couple peers with different perspectives than mine:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;All that matters is optics&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about it, it won&rsquo;t help and will only make you the bad guy&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, unfortunately they (especially the latter) understood our particular situation better.</p>
<p>I had a tough conversation yesterday, where I found out that my transparency about a couple problems led me to being seen in an unfavorable light, even when my goal was to follow our organizational value: &ldquo;<em>Do the right thing. Always.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>In both situations, when I voiced those concerns (to the right persons) and the danger they posed to the org, I came with a set of concrete and positive recommendations for addressing the problems.</p>
<p>Because there was no evident follow-up or improvement from the proposed positive action plans, I had check-ins (once on the first situation and twice on the second), and they were seen as &ldquo;coming back a lot&rdquo; and as if I had ulterior motives.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reflecting on that a lot this weekend, and what I might have done better.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Believing falsehoods because those falsehoods reinforce our preferred narratives is not harmless. Promoting falsehoods to benefit your faction is not harmless, particularly in a well-armed society. If we remain locked in our own echo chambers, inevitably there will a voice of the echo chamber that speaks in the language of mass murder, believing it justified. This album describes that tragic inevitability.</p>

			 <p>Doing a Roon trial after <a href="https://micro.blog/rcrackley">@rcrackley</a> brought it to my attention, again.</p>
<p>Quick Day 1 notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like that it shows listening charts based on <em>time</em> not <em>tracks</em></li>
<li>Some parts of the system seem to favor albums, and others tracks, and I can&rsquo;t figure out the design principle yet</li>
<li>Scrobbling seems to work ok, though there are some mismatches due to the &ldquo;enhancement&rdquo; they do to artist/title</li>
<li>Arc is supposed to work off-network, but looks like it doesn&rsquo;t without some extra networking work (similar to Plex)</li>
<li>However, Roon may handle scrobbling better on Arc downloads than PlexAmp downloads (i.e. counting them when it reconnects). I haven&rsquo;t 100% verified this, yet (For PlexAmp, you have to trick it by playing from a playlist that you happen to have downloaded, instead of playing the download, and then it will sync on reconnect)</li>
<li>Genre choices are little <em>interesting</em> at times, but it seems things may at least get multiple genres? Not sure on that, either.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not clear how tagging works or what it adds aside from the other options</li>
<li>A little lack of clarity around how library is managed when you have some local files and some streaming tracks (e.g. Tidal) that are related, or when you have incomplete albums</li>
</ul>
<p>So far, not at all worth the 3x (monthly) to 7x (lifetime) cost increase over Plex/PlexAmp (especially considering you get many other functions with Plex unrelated to music, as well as a discount on your Tidal monthly subscription).</p>

			 <p>This October, we are trying an experiment.</p>
<p>The only packages, purchases, and provisions that will come into our home will be those delivered by our own people-power (i.e. walking, biking, or the like).</p>
<p>That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>No online retailers</li>
<li>No meal delivery or meal kits</li>
<li>No carloads of groceries or other items</li>
</ul>
<p>We will only make an exception (this time) for any individual item that we need but is too big to transport on it&rsquo;s own (e.g. an appliance, large outdoor item, or something like that).</p>
<h3 id="but-why">But Why?</h3>
<p>Many people have to live like this already, and many more of us will as the financial and ecological cost of delivery rises. We want to see how prepared we are. We also expect we will learn more about our habits. We might find we can forego some things that we currently believe are necessities.</p>

If you don&rsquo;t make it past the first or second row is it even a dive? Style. No floundering. Looking like a dead fish isn&rsquo;t gonna get you anywhere. And hight.

<p>&ldquo;Electrons orbit the nucleus of an atom in different “states”, which form regions that are called “bands”. These bands keep their electrons firmly in place. In between these bands are “bandgaps” – states in which no electron can be.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conductors have no bandgaps, and so electrons flow through them. That is why a copper wire conducts electricity, for example. In insulators (like wood, glass, plastics, or ceramics), there is a very wide bandgap, which blocks the flow of electricity. Finally, in semiconductors, there’s a relatively narrow bandgap. That allows them to either act as an insulator or a conductor. Semiconductors can become conductors when they absorb a “photon” (an elementary particle of light) with an energy potential equal to or greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor material.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>re: <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/08/05/an-anarchist-firefly.html">this conversation</a></p>
<h2 id="sources">Sources</h2>
<p>Though it may sound hokey, my biggest inspiration is the teachings of Jesus in the synoptic gospels and the response of the church in Acts. The anabaptist tradition (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/28/yr-mennonite.html">my particular tradition</a>) has a strain of anarchist-related thinking, and many works from the Anabaptist traditions will indirectly or directly reference anarchist ways of being.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Thus, I have explored many Christian Anarchist (or at least adjacent) books. This is a (partial) selection from our home library:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Admittedly some of the directly-anarchist works are worse at making the case than non-explicitly anarchist ones. <em>(note: <a href="https://canadianmennonite.org/articles/disclaimer-be-included-john-howard-yoder-books">a warning/disclaimer about John Howard Yoder</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>I also have a lifetime membership at <a href="https://www.pmpress.org/">PM Press</a>, which publishes many anarchist works. Similar publishers include <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/">Verso Books</a> and <a href="https://www.akpress.org/">AK Press</a>. In addition, the <a href="https://c4ss.org/">Center for a Stateless Society</a> traditionally published many thoughtful essays and books (like <em>Markets Not Capitalism</em>), though I have not read much there in recent years.</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading Ursula K. LeGuin and David Graeber.</p>
<h2 id="my-perspective">My Perspective</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;🏴&rdquo; section of <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/06/02/in-that-order.html">this &ldquo;about me&rdquo; post </a> is a very short summary of how I think about anarchism.</p>
<p>To me, it&rsquo;s less something to be immediately (or ever?) achieved, and more of a direction or vision. Like the <em>Kingdom of God</em>, it&rsquo;s both already among us and not yet complete. When you help your neighbor instead of reporting them to the HOA or city government, anarchy is among you. When you work through conflict without resorting to coercion or violence, anarchy is among you. When you practice mutual support, anarchy is among you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The original “Iron Man” script was decidedly pacifist, with protagonist Tony Stark attempting to use his enormous manufacturing empire to battle against war profiteers and the military industrial complex. However, after the Pentagon got involved&hellip;the tone of the movie was radically altered. Much of the fighting in the movie takes place in modern-day Afghanistan, with the U.S. military serving the role of the good guys. In this sense, the film’s stance on war was reversed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I’ve come to think of this trend as the ‘Slow Water’ movement. Like the Slow Food movement founded in Italy in the late 20th century in opposition to fast food and all its ills, Slow Water seeks to remedy the ways in which redirecting and speeding water off the land causes problems.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Slow Water mimics or collaborates with natural systems, restoring space for water to slow on land in wetlands, floodplains, mountain meadows, forests, tidal marshes, and mangroves. Slow Water is distributed, not centralised: think of the wet zones scattered throughout a wild watershed instead of a big dam and reservoir. It is also socially just: Slow Water doesn’t take water from some people to give to others, or protect some communities while pushing floods on to another. Slow Water gives communities agency to restore resilience to their local landscapes and revive local cultures. And in taking a systems-oriented approach, it simultaneously supports local water availability, flood control, natural carbon storage, and other-than-human life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These studies involve humans where they give them 180, 200 grams of fructose in a day. Within a couple weeks, they would have many metabolic issues. But this would not happen when these individuals received that level of fructose but had its metabolism blocked by simply giving them a gout pill called allopurinol. I want to mention parenthetically that quercetin as a nutritional supplement works almost as effectively as allopurinol. I mentioned earlier, it targets the same enzyme called xanthine oxidase. One study in 22 young men with mild elevation of their uric acid over eight weeks giving them 500 milligrams a day of quercetin dropped their uric acid by about 8%, just in eight weeks. So you’re targeting that enzyme involved in the manufacturing of uric acid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;fructose causes non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (or NAFLD), while alcohol causes alcohol-associated fatty liver disease. However, as also mentioned earlier, the two are almost identical in appearance. This led us to wonder whether alcohol causes liver disease because it stimulates fructose production. To test this, we gave alcohol to mice that could not break down fructose. Amazingly, the alcohol failed to cause liver disease. In other words, fructose is also the cause of alcohol-induced liver disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the best type of exercise to improve mitochondrial function? Many studies have examined this.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>First, it needs to be an endurance type of exercise, such as walking, exercising on a treadmill, swimming, or cycling, as opposed to a non-endurance activity like weight lifting.
Second, it is most effective if you are either fasting or do not eat any carbohydrates before the exercise.
Third, the exercise has to be sustained for at least one hour, and be done at least three or four times a week. This is because it takes some time to activate the process of mitochondrial growth, and exercising less than thirty minutes at a time rarely achieves this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have a tough message to share, or when you are so convinced of your own rightness that you may push too hard, remember to STATE your path:
• Share your facts. Start with the least controversial, most persuasive elements from your Path to Action.
• Tell your story. Explain what you’re beginning to conclude.
• Ask for others’ paths. Encourage others to share both their facts and their stories.
• Talk tentatively. State your story as a story—don’t disguise it as a fact.
• Encourage testing. Make it safe for others to express differing or even opposing views.&rdquo; (Kerry Patterson, Ron McMillan, Joseph Grenny, Al Switzler, Crucial Conversations Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High)</p>

<p>&ldquo;An engineer&rsquo;s role is to engineer solutions. Writing code is certainly a part of that, but as a means to an end rather than a purpose in itself. If an elegant, scalable solution can be engineered without writing code, fantastic. Conversely, if code is written without exploration, reflection, documentation and validation, or if a solution is built to an imagined problem that doesn&rsquo;t really exist, we&rsquo;re in trouble. Communication, exploration, and collaboration are the biggest parts of the job.&rdquo; (Ben Werdmüller, Engineering vs Writing Code)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>•   <em>Mindfulness:</em> The goal of mindfulness here isn&rsquo;t stress reduction, but simply being more effective at <em>noticing</em> what we&rsquo;re feeling.
•   <em>Exercise:</em> Regular physical activity attunes us to the physiological manifestations of emotion and allows us to sense an emotional response sooner.
•   <em>Sleep:</em> Ample research shows that when we&rsquo; re not well-rested our ability to sense and regulate emotion is impaired.
•   <em>(Reducing Chronic) Stress:</em> Chronic, low-level stress diminishes our ability to regulate emotion, and there are often stressors we can minimize with some modest changes in our daily routines.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bioregionalism, whose tenets were articulated by the environmentalist Peter Berg in the 1970s, and which is widely visible in indigenous land practices, has to do with an awareness not only of the many life-forms of each place, but how they are interrelated, including with humans. Bioregionalist thought encompasses practices like habitat restoration and permaculture farming, but has a cultural element as well, since it asks us to identify as citizens of the bioregion as much as (if not more than) the state. Our “citizenship” in a bioregion means not only familiarity with the local ecology but a commitment to stewarding it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Native to northern North America</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The American cranberrybush is an attractive deciduous shrub. Despite its common name, it isn’t actually a type of cranberry tree. A member of the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/adoxaceae">moschatel family (<em>Adoxaceae</em>)</a>, it is distinguished by cranberry-like fruits, maple-like foliage, and reddish-brown branches and stems. Its white blooms are produced in corymb-type inflorescences, with the outermost flowers being larger than the innermost ones.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In the wild, this shrub <a href="https://www.illinoiswildflowers.info/trees/plants/am_cranbush.html">favors cool and consistently moist habitats</a>. Its mature specimens can tolerate wet conditions along the edges of thickets, ditches, swamps, streambanks, and bogs. It is frequently found in relatively pristine wetland systems, where it serves as a vital species for winged pollinators (e.g. syrphid flies, andrenid bees, halictid bees, beetles). The red fruits support the survival of many native birds through winter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>V. trilobum</em> typically grows to about 13 feet (4 meters) tall in optimal conditions. It should be cultivated close to a consistent source of water. Its roots thrive best in substrates with a rich organic matter profile, whereas its foliage requires full to partial sun conditions to produce the necessary compounds for rapid growth.&quot; (Pond Informer (Abi), 11 Shrubs &amp; Bushes That Like Wet Soil 2022 [Updated])</p>

<p>&ldquo;In 1984, toward the end of a long career studying relations between landscape and culture, the historian and critic J.B. Jackson alighted on a new definition for his subject. <strong>Landscape</strong>, he argued, is “<em>space deliberately created to speed up or slow down the process of nature</em>.”&rdquo; (Brett Milligan, Accelerated and Decelerated Landscapes)</p>

			<h1><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/03/19/white-male-fear.html">White Male Fear: The Insecurity Behind Hunting Culture</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/03/19/white-male-fear.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2023-03-19 08:32:50 -0400">Mar 19, 2023</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><em>We saw some 🦌 this morning and my friend reflected that “white tail deer” sounds like “white male fear”, so here’s an essay courtesy of GPT.</em></p>
<p>Hunting has long been a popular pastime in many parts of the world, and in the United States, hunting culture is often associated with a specific demographic: white men. While some may view hunting as a harmless activity, it is important to acknowledge the underlying psychological and cultural factors that drive this activity. Specifically, hunting culture is often driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males.</p>
<p>At its core, hunting is about exerting control over the natural world. Hunters seek to demonstrate their dominance over animals, proving their strength and skill in the process. For many white men, this desire for control reflects a deeper fear of losing power and status in society. In a world where white male privilege is being challenged, hunting becomes a way to reassert dominance over nature, and by extension, over other people.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hunting is often marketed as a way to reconnect with nature and escape the stresses of modern life. However, this idealized version of hunting is often at odds with the reality of the activity. In many cases, hunting involves the use of high-powered weapons and technology that provide hunters with a significant advantage over their prey. This emphasis on technology and efficiency further underscores the need to prove one&rsquo;s dominance and control.</p>
<p>The culture surrounding hunting also reinforces this sense of insecurity and fear. Hunting is often depicted as a rite of passage for young men, a way to prove their worth and masculinity. The emphasis on strength and skill reinforces traditional gender roles, and the culture of competition that surrounds hunting encourages men to measure their worth against others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, hunting culture is driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males. While the activity may be marketed as a way to reconnect with nature or assert dominance over animals, the underlying psychological and cultural factors are rooted in a desire for control and a fear of losing power and status. By acknowledging these underlying factors, we can begin to have more honest and nuanced conversations about the role of hunting in our society, and work towards a more equitable and sustainable relationship with the natural world.</p>

			 <p>Perhaps you’ve heard some recent controversy around Wizards of the Coast and Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Perhaps you haven’t. Either way, it’s a great time to look at some alternatives to Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> I’m going to limit the list to games that are <strong>fantasy</strong>, <strong>adventuring</strong>, and <strong>flexible-setting</strong>, otherwise this list would be much longer. If you want recommendations that ignore one of those factors, I’m happy to share some other options.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use <strong>tags</strong> because those are a fun RPG thing.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>compatible</strong>: it shares enough in common with D&amp;D-like games that it should be easier to use published adversaries or adventures</li>
<li><strong>credited</strong>: you&rsquo;ll find my name in the credits</li>
<li><strong>light</strong>: it&rsquo;s a rules-light system</li>
<li><strong>played</strong>: I&rsquo;ve tried it</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the games, in alphabetical order:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/113405/Beyond-the-Wall-and-Other-Adventures?affiliate_id=21283">Beyond the Wall</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, has some extra focus on group-building, and a bit more setting &amp; vibe built-in</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/161477/Cornerstone-Fantasy?affiliate_id=21283">Cornerstone Fantasy</a>: <strong>light</strong>, the first of three <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/8026/Sigil-Stone-Publishing?affiliate_id=21283">Sigil Stone</a> games on the list, but one that appears will not be getting ongoing support and development</li>
<li><a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/dichotomy">Dichotomy</a> (<a href="https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/123101/dichotomy">backup link</a>): a super-indie game with an interesting angle akin to <a href="https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings">Lasers &amp; Feelings</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcanum:_Of_Steamworks_and_Magick_Obscura">Arcanum</a></li>
<li><a href="http://dominionrules.org/">Dominion Rules</a>: <strong>played</strong>, a highly-underrated game with several great ideas and tons of potential</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/101050/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-RPG-DCC-RPG?affiliate_id=21283">Dungeon Crawl Classics</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, recommended if you want big time &ldquo;old-school&rdquo; vibes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264584/Five-Torches-Deep?affiliate_id=21283">Five Torches Deep</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, essentially a pared-down 5th edition</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258593/Forbidden-Lands-Core-Game?affiliate_id=21283">Forbidden Lands</a>: strong on open-world play, also with some built-in vibes</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/399483/Into-the-Odd--Remastered?affiliate_id=21283">Into the Odd</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, arguably not strictly-fantasy enough, but usable for lots of play with some table-tweaking</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave?affiliate_id=21283">Knave</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>light</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, top recommendation if you just want to get going with quick play</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=21283">Maze Rats</a>: <strong>light</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, top recommendation for a pickup game with no compatibility needed</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/243769/MYTHIC-D6-Revised--Expanded?affiliate_id=21283">Mythic D6</a>: descendant of the West End Games D6 system (like classic Star Wars)</li>
<li><a href="https://paizo.com/pathfinder">Pathfinder</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, recommended if you liked 3rd edition</li>
<li><a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/torchbearer/">Torchbearer</a>: <strong>credited</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, descendant of <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/">Burning Wheel</a>, recommended for those emphasizing the hard life of adventurers</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/240583/Vagabonds-of-Dyfed?affiliate_id=21283">Vagabonds of Dyfed</a>: <strong>light</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, an interesting mashup of D&amp;D and PbtA roots, which shouldn&rsquo;t really work but kinda does</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/82643/Warrior-Rogue--Mage?affiliate_id=21283">Warrior Rogue Mage</a>: <strong>light</strong>, answers &ldquo;what if the core archetypes were the stats?&rdquo;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/432645/whitehack-fourth-edition?affiliate_id=21283">Whitehack</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, <strong>played</strong>, top recommendation if you want to run a compatible-but-flexible game that lasts many sessions (e.g. campaign-mode)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number?affiliate_id=21283">Worlds Without Number</a>: <strong>compatible</strong>, recommended for the worldbuilding and adventure-creation tools</li>

<p>I use and recommend <a href="https://libbyapp.com/">Libby</a> for getting ebooks and audiobooks from the library. Most books I borrow digitally, but there are exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books I plan to re-read</li>
<li>Deluxe or art-filled editions</li>
<li>Books I will use as a referenrce</li>
<li>Books I enjoyed and want to keep around</li>
</ul>
<p>For those cases, I get physical editions via <a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis">Bookshop</a>. And lest you think I don&rsquo;t really do physical books: my household has <strong>15</strong> brimming bookshelves.</p>
<p>I take copious highlights and notes, and save them to Readwise. <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/04/09/being-wise-with.html">Here&rsquo;s how.</a> Highlights and notes are especially important for me with digital books, where spacial-temporal recollection is not as easy, but spaced-repitition and note-linking can make up for it (and then some).</p>
<p>I track my reading in <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/toddgrotenhuis">The StoryGraph</a>. I prefer it because <em>not Amazon</em> and because it incorporates some data elements <strong>other than ratings</strong> which are useful for describing and finding books. I&rsquo;m hoping micro.blog&rsquo;s <a href="https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves">bookshelves</a> feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn&rsquo;t handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we&rsquo;ll see what the future holds.)</p>
<p>I keep my to-read/wishlist as a <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd">Bookshop list</a>, for ease of sharing and gift-giving.</p>

<h1 id="analysis">Analysis</h1>
<p>This was an mixed year for reading goals. I exceeded by book goal (55 out of 53) but missed by pages goal (15,868 out of 17,500). I&rsquo;ll go for 60 books next year, but keep the 17,500 page goal.</p>
<p>Similar to my normal ratio, I read 63% fiction this year:</p>

<p>I continue to add to my <em>intentionality</em> in reading, seeking a variety of voices, formats, styles, etc. With such a long list of things I&rsquo;d like to read, I&rsquo;m also trying to be wiser about what I should read <em>sooner than later</em> such as things related to health or permaculture.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s to a good year of reading!</p>

			 <p>A person in risk &amp; security can generally be thought of as acting like one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineer</li>
<li>Analyst</li>
<li>Influencer</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly (and helpfully), this is independent of official title. You&rsquo;ve probably met engineers whose main operating mode is as the advocate, or leaders who act more like high-level analysts, or ops or risk analysts who focus on building capabilities.</p>
<p>Like all models, this has limitations, but it is <strong>useful</strong>. It can help you think about what&rsquo;s missing, where strengths are, what structure should look like, etc.</p>

			 <p>⚽️ Croatia vs. Morocco</p>
<p><em>sorta live-blogged</em></p>
<ul>
<li>⚽️ Great setpiece from Croatia. Breaks through the Morocco defense that had been so strong in most of the tournament</li>
<li>⚽️ &hellip;and Morocco equalizes on the <strong>very next play</strong></li>
<li>Much more attacking chaos that we saw from both of these teams in their earlier stalwart defeneses</li>
<li>⚽️ Persistence for Croatia pulls off</li>
<li>Announcers said 3rd place games tend to be high-scoring, and depsite the defensive skill of these teams that prediction is coming true</li>
<li>Croatia has practiced a number of interesting setpieces</li>
<li>Feeling bad for Morocco on these injuries and subs</li>
<li>Couple tough calls there from the refs, and probably should have been a PK for Croatia and yellow (but not PK, outside the box) at the other end</li>
<li>Congratulations to Croatia</li>

<p>“But there are two very different phenomena at play here, each of which subvert the flow of information in very distinct ways. Let’s call them <em>echo chambers</em> and <em>epistemic bubbles</em>. Both are social structures that systematically exclude sources of information. Both exaggerate their members’ confidence in their beliefs. But they work in entirely different ways, and they require very different modes of intervention. An epistemic bubble is when you don’t <em>hear</em> people from the other side. An <strong>echo</strong> chamber is what happens when you don’t <em>trust</em> people from the other side.”</p>

			 <p>🕹 Elder Scrolls IV (Oblivion) leveling adaption:</p>
<p>Want to focus on your preferred playstyle and not be penalized for not micromanaging skill-ups to get three +5s each level?</p>
<p>When you level, count how many points you are missing from a +15 total. Go to the console and put in the following commmand:</p>
<ul>
<li>modpca $YourLowestAttribute $ThatNumber</li>
</ul>
<p>This keeps you at +15 attributes each level and has the level-balancing system keep in a reasonable range.</p>

			 <p>This game is gonna be up there with the Snow Clasico in terms of memorable and surreal #USMNT games ⚽️</p>
<p><em>Explainer: this was a CONCACAF Nations League game, where USA are defending champs. They were playing El Salvador, who had not beat the USA since 1992. It was a messy and clumsy and chaotic game due to the field being terribly muddy. El Salvador scored first and was up. USA got a bad red card. Then El Salvador got one for at attack that ended in a long muddy slip’n’slide. USA drew the game in overtime.</em></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Reply</strong>: you can send a <a href="https://indieweb.org/Webmention">webmention</a> as a reply to this post, reply on micro.blog (see link below), or reply by email (see link below).</li>
<li><strong>Place an element</strong>: pick from the menu below (a terrain selection or a point of interest), and give me coordinates for it. I&rsquo;ll place it if it doesn&rsquo;t invalidate one I already placed, and then update the map.</li>
<li><strong>Two then you</strong>: you only get to take another turn if two other changes have happened since the one you requested.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="menu">Menu</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Terrain</strong> (color): Choose 3 hexes of one terrain type and 1 hex of another terrain type. They must be contiguous (connected) with one another. Assume hexes are 25 miles-ish. I&rsquo;ll need coordinates for all 4. <em>Note: All hexes will eventually get a terrain.</em>
<ol>
<li><strong>Swamp</strong> (green): soggy areas filled with things that lurk, where people scrap together whatever safety they can, often on stilts or in the trees</li>
<li><strong>Wasteland</strong> (purple): radiation, toxic spills, infestation, or other terrible things make this land inhospitable to all but the most resilient of beings</li>
<li><strong>Desert</strong> (orange): whether sand, rock, glass, or worse, people here are often nomadic, seeking out scarce resources wherever they can find them</li>
<li><strong>Mountain</strong> (black): steep, formidable, and buffeted by strong winds, people usually live and move inside, rather than trying to cross them</li>
<li><strong>Archipelago</strong> (teal): the waters are filled with small islands, harsh storms, and predators, and people make their way around in small craft and flotillas</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Point of interest</strong> (letter). Only one of these may exist on a hex. You can place them regardless of if the terrain is chosen already, or not.
<ol>
<li><strong>Skyship</strong> (S): It looms overhead, slowly making its way across the landscape. <em>Restriction</em>: only one on the map. If it is already placed, you may choose this again to move it one hex in any direction.</li>
<li><strong>Metropolis</strong> (M): What could even sustain a population in these horrid lands? Something has, because many are here. <em>Restriction</em>: only one per terrain type.</li>
<li><strong>Gathering</strong> (G): There are people here, though in smaller quantity. Maybe permanently as a settlement, maybe temporarily or nomadically.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong> (C): Nobody wants to be here, not even those involved.</li>
<li><strong>Ruin</strong> (R): Wonders from a previous era, for those brave or foolish enough to investigate.</li>
<li><strong>Phenomenon</strong> (P): This strange thing shouldn&rsquo;t exist, and yet reports say it does.</li>
</ol>
</li>

It is an affiliate link (though you can and should change to your local favorite bookshop), but if you buy any of them via my storefront, I will put that money back into getting more books and sharing the good ones.</em></p>
<p>I read 48 books in 2021. As I mentioned in my <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html">2021 service recommendations</a> I use StoryGraph to track reading, so you can see <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/toddgrotenhuis?year=2021">an overview of my reading there</a>.</p>
<p>But just because I read a book doesn&rsquo;t mean it was good! Here are the ones I recommend:</p>

			 <p>As <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/31/nice-bonus-item.html">mentioned in a previous post</a>, I received a new journal with quotes on the recto pages. I decided I would write short reflections on these, and sometimes I will share them to my blog. Here’s the first:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Disobedience, in the eyes of any one who has read history, is man&rsquo;s original virtue. It is through disobedience that progress has been made, through disobedience and through rebellion.&rdquo;
-Oscar Wilde</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Disobedience, yes, but not the childish kind that says, &ldquo;I can do whatever I want and you can’t stop me”. Rather, the kind that knows the rules well enough, knows the community well enough, knows the problems well enough…to demand something better. Without the understanding, it is selfish flailing. With this understanding, it can lead to much needed change, benefit to the community.</p>
<p>I can’t find the source right now, but I recently heard someone implement a practice that went like this: “you can change the rule once you understand why the old rule was there.”</p>

			 <p>There’s so much good music out there that I’m tempted to make an “only buy from Bandcamp” rule. 🎶</p>
<p>I’m so frustrated by labels that focus on streaming or selling from bad distributors. In the before times I could at least pickup the disc at a show.</p>

			 <p>I started writing this on Friday the 10th, but am just now posting, because&hellip;</p>
<p>🔒 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/hackers-launch-over-840000-attacks-through-log4j-flaw/">The Log4j issue</a> is <em>really bad</em>. Security and engineering teams are scrambling to protect against attacks. The best teams started last week or weekend, but many organizations waited until Monday or later to get going. The vulnerability is once again hitting the hard problems of inventory management, 3rd-party software component management, and vendor management. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen something this bad in 20 years of being a security practitioner. The vulnerability is easy to exploit, has the worst kind of impact (it runs the attacker&rsquo;s code), and is present in many common technologies. In addition, there have been several follow-on problems identified, such as additional attacks, or weaknesses in the fixes for the attack! If you&rsquo;d like a laugh instead of cry, check <a href="https://log4jmemes.com">log4j memes</a>.</p>
<p>⚽️ After a really great start to the Premiere League (where they were recently top of the table) and Champions League (where they are reigning champions), <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en">Chelsea</a> are leaking goals and struggling at this point in the seasons. 3-3 vs. Zenit in the CL means they take 2nd spot (below Juventus), but are on to the round of 16 and matched up with Lille. They got a little lucky in the Leeds PL game to win 3-2, but tied 1-1 in what should have been an easy win at home against Everton.</p>
<p>🛩 I recently had my 2nd business travel since &ldquo;the beforetimes&rdquo;. I tested when I got back and am luckily safe. I welcomed my new team members (direct and indirect reports) and honed 2022 strategy with the leaders on my team. It was good getting people together, but still feels a little strange getting back to it! In other work news, I also got the promotion I had been hoping for, bringing me to only 1 to 2 levels below my internal customers and working peers 😆. (Outside my team, I primarily work with SVPs and VPs, and am now an AVP.) Joking aside, I am thankful for the support of my leaders, who have shown trust in me and helped find funding and assistance for the important initiatives I&rsquo;ve been pushing.</p>
<p>📚 My spouse and I registered for a new library. To be honest, we mostly did it to have another library in <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby/Overdive</a>, but it turns out the library is lovely, too. There&rsquo;s no public funding in the town for a library and kids had to pay high fees to get access to a library in one of the neighboring towns. So, one family donated the land, funds for the building, and funds for the initial collection of materials. The library stays afloat with donations and a modest yearly fee for patrons. We were charmed by the library, especially their themed puzzle 🧩 collection that you can borrow like books!</p>
<p>🌟🎄 I&rsquo;m looking forward to a break, soon. We&rsquo;ll be hosting my spouse&rsquo;s side of the family, again. All (who can be) are vaccinated (and boosted) and we will be testing before we get together. We have folks with compromised immune systems and/or who are too young to be vaccinated, but we are being safe for each other. We&rsquo;re very much looking forward to time together, as there has been so little of that in the last two years.</p>

			 <p>Looking for some inspiration from our #NED microbloggers to help us with cool names. Though the house is a tall A-frame, we don&rsquo;t just want to call it Te Grotenhuis 😆. Our interim name is Kingfisher Kreek. There is a kreek, ~3 acres of vijver, ~15 acres of houtsoorten.  We see a lot of:</p>
<ul>
<li>ijsvogel</li>
<li>schildpad</li>
<li>hert</li>
<li>reiger</li>
</ul>
<p>We also want it to be a place many people can visit and find solace. We&rsquo;ve toyed with English words like &ldquo;sanctuary&rdquo; or &ldquo;haven.&rdquo;</p>

			 <p>One of the things I do on Monday mornings is to review my <em>Guiding Principles</em>. At the top of the page, I have a couple reminders for how to use them:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;I have a rule&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;I am the kind of person who&hellip;&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Because ultimately they are about habit/identity formation.</p>

			 <p>🥃 For those wondering, this is the &ldquo;authentic&rdquo; recipe for a &ldquo;Cool Toddy&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 fingers of Costco/Kirkland 12-yr big-bottle blended scotch</li>
<li>1 finger of Brown County port</li>
<li>2 large cubes of ice</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to diverge a bit you can use different whiskys/whiskies and different ports (I prefer tawny if diverging), but part of the point is to keep it reasonably priced rather than buying rare sherry- or port-casked whisky.</p>

I&rsquo;ve been communicating with my manager using the perspective of &quot;accountability without authority or responsibility&quot;, and while that&rsquo;s true, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unicorn Project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ideals might be an even better lens by which to view the problems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me work through them to see what we are doing or could do in each area.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Locality and Simplicity<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the core issue, as I&rsquo;ve recently been thinking about it. My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don&rsquo;t necessarily add value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle. I&rsquo;ve been advocating for this two-step approach, but now have a different way to talk about it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Focus, Flow, and Joy<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We have a culture of meetings. This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;ve got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I&rsquo;ve been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We&rsquo;ve got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I&rsquo;m helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Improvement of Daily Work<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->There isn&rsquo;t a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn&rsquo;t have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it&rsquo;s very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->my time<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Psychological Safety<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to speak up, that their concerns won&rsquo;t be dismissed and they won&rsquo;t be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won&rsquo;t be penalized for trying something new. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Customer Focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We can think about customer focus in two ways.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The first is the most important: the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->end<!-- raw HTML omitted --> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->The second is the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->internal<!-- raw HTML omitted --> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn&rsquo;t used to thinking about <!-- raw HTML omitted -->having<!-- raw HTML omitted --> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <!-- raw HTML omitted -->we<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are the internal customer.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Who will use the product or service?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What do they need?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->How does that inform our requirements?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->etc.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>I love the idea of Ugmonk&rsquo;s <a href="https://ugmonk.com/pages/analog">Analog</a> system. Yet, as you may know (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/02/19/how-i-take.html">from a previous post</a>), I have a system that is working well for me for daily notes &amp; tracking tasks.</p>
<p>Still, there are times I need to jot some notes by hand. Maybe I&rsquo;m brainstorming, doing a little journaling, or writing a follow-up while presenting (a common occurrence).</p>
<p>The good news is that Baron Fig&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.baronfig.com/accessories/strategist-index-cards?style=dot+grid">Strategist</a> cards fit in the holder perfectly, too. You get the nice standing view, as well as the card storage in the block. I expect this would work well with any rounded-corner 3x5 index cards, too. (If you have others that you try, <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact">let me know</a>!)</p>

			 <p><em>edit: this is no longer accurate, but I&rsquo;m leaving it for legacy purposes/posterity. Craft Docs also now has dates/todos as a first-class item.</em></p>
<p>I’ve used Evernote, Roam, Obsidian, Notion, Bear, Drafts, IA Writer, various Zettelkasten tools, and many other systems to try to organize all my notes. But none of them have worked for me like <a href="https://www.craft.do/">Craft.do</a> has.</p>
<p>I can’t put my finger exactly on why it’s the winner, but it’s some combination of features, speed, visual appeal/distinctiveness, and customer-responsiveness. (The price point is great, too!)</p>
<p>I have three different workspaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>My second brain/public notes/digital garden (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/digital-garden/">link</a>)</li>
<li>Personal notes &amp; tasks (<em>what we’re here to talk about today!</em>)</li>
<li>A shared space for home &amp; family<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
</ol>
<p>So, how am I handling my personal notes &amp; tasks? Let’s dive in.</p>
<h3 id="considerations">Considerations</h3>
<p>I want notes to be easy-to-enter. I want them to accommodate both daily planning, ongoing note-taking, and tie-ins to project, people, or topic pages.</p>
<p>I like the idea of Leuchtturm’s <a href="https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/some-lines-a-day-the-5-year-memory-book.html">5-year journals</a>, which give the ability to look back on what I was doing this day in previous years. But, for me, it’s hard for me to to keep a good habit of writing in them.</p>
<h3 id="the-setup">The Setup</h3>
<p>I created a top level page (a “Document”, in Craft parlance) called “Dailies”. I made it one of my <em>Starred Documents</em> for easy access.</p>
<p>“Dailies” has sub-pages for each month. Each of <em>those</em> subpages has day subpages. Here&rsquo;s what that looks like.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Let me explain a few things you’re seeing here.</p>
<p>First, sub-pages show a bit of their internal content, by default<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. I didn’t start until the 10th of January, so that’s why you’ll see January’s first internal entry being “10”.</p>
<p>Second, you’ll see March is empty but April is not. This is because I created the April 1st entry ahead of time, because I have something planned (for April Fools). This is an <em>intended feature</em> of my system: the ability to put a note or task on a future date, so that I see it when I get there.</p>
<p>Third, you’ll see the bottom of this page (and all pages) have a “Links To This Page” section. These are backlinks, an important feature. Craft supports linking to pages, subpages, and lines/blocks to show the backlinks on the page that is being referenced elsewhere.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="the-month">The Month</h2>
<p>Ok, so what does it look like when we dive into a month? Here’s that April view.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I went ahead and created the 2nd through 10th subpages, so you can see how the month view shows up. There’s nothing particularly exciting about the monthly subpage. It’s just a container.</p>
<p>But, as you can see with April 1st, I’m setup so that there’s a little preview of the top content for each day.</p>
<p>Let’s move on to…</p>
<h3 id="the-day">The Day</h3>
<p>Ok, this is the heart of it, then. Here’s how I might take notes for a day:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Again, a few points to note:</p>
<p>You can see in the upper left the hierarchy of notes I’m “in”. This is in my Dailies page, February subpage, and 19th page.</p>
<p>To get that year-over-year view, I’m using a toggle list feature to create a section for the year (and then for future years). This allows me to open the toggle and review previous years when I first open the note in future years, but then close the toggle to focus on the current date/year.</p>
<p>My notes are a combination of things I want to accomplish, things I’m considering, and micro-journaling of what I do throughout the day.</p>
<p><em>All</em> of these lines can be subpages themselves (meaning I can go into it and take more notes), or can contain links to other pages, subpages, or blocks within my workspace. I often link to pages I&rsquo;ve created for projects, people, or topics. (<em>and then on that page I can see backlinks to this reference!</em>)</p>
<p>The tasks can be checked off and completed.</p>
<p>Finally, just as I’ve linked out to other places, I have backlinks inbound to this date from other places. I can follow those links to see the connections.</p>
<p><em>Not pictured</em>: I can add in-app sketches, scanned notes, documents, or images to my daily page.</p>
<h3 id="other-factors">Other Factors</h3>
<p>I also keep a document that is my intake document, so all items that come in from OSX or iOS sharesheet go there first.</p>
<p>I have templates, including day start, week start, and week end. These include processing that intake inbox, making sure new notes have the correct home, and completing my planning and review activities.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>I’m finding this process works very well for me. It’s easy to stick with. It let’s me keep everything in one place. It lets me find and search for what I need, easily. It’s not ugly. It’s fun to work with.</p>

<p><em>Proverbs 6: 16-19</em></p>
<hr>
<p>43: the number of senators who were too scared or too shortsighted to vote in favor of conviction.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it’s not surprising that the vote did not pass. More interesting is that there were actually <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/14/republican-rebels-trump-impeachment-trial">7 brave senators who did the right thing</a>. In the modern USA, tribal affiliation &amp; licentious grandstanding are much more important than truth, liberty, or justice.</p>
<p>“This is not who we are”, people said after mobs attacked congress. But unfortunately, it <em>is</em> part of who we are. And the result of this vote is another signal that it is part of who we are <em>and who we will continue to be</em>.</p>
<p>That is why I said “shortsighted”: far too many people are continuing to normalize lying and violence as acceptable means to achieve political goals. This is the road to ruin.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This vote (and continued denialist behavior) all-but-guarantees that we will have more political violence. Further, the next populist &amp; would-be-autocrat is unlikely to be as bumbling as 45, and much more capable at helping the powerful &amp; politically-connected at the cost of everyone else.</p>
<p>All with good will towards humanity should seek to prevent the rise of the next dangerous populist, and to limit the harm that they can do if they gain power.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things Christians are called to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speak truth and refuse conspiracy, lies, and false witness<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Love our neighbors and the people we encounter, especially ones unlike us<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
<li>When we feel a loss of power &amp; privilege, feel maligned, or have been harmed: love our enemies &amp; persecutors and pray for them<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></li>
<li>Seek the good of the poor, the prisoner, the ailing, the oppressed<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, the widow, the orphan, and the foreigner<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></li>
<li>Dismantle our weapons and create tools that support life<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup></li>

<p>Do you know your top strengths? When it comes to personal assessments, the Strengthsfinder (or Clifton Strengths) is my favorite. Based on research from Gallup, Strengthsfinder looks at 34 different themes, and helps you understand what your best approaches are.</p>
<p>You can get the <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781595620156">Strengthsfinder 2.0 book here</a>. It includes a code to take the short assessment and receive your top 5 strengths. (You can also unlock more of your strengths <a href="https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/strengthsfinder.aspx">on their site</a>.)</p>
<p>The research behind the strengths shows that we can make a much bigger difference by leaning into our strengths than by focusing on our weaknesses. While we might need a certain level of baseline proficiency for some roles &amp; responsibilities, after meeting those requirements, our time is most impactful if spent on the ways where we do our best.</p>
<p>My top ten strengths are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Activator (I)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Intellection (S)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Analytical (S)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ideation (S)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Command (I)</strong></li>
<li>Connectedness (R)</li>
<li>Input (S)</li>
<li>Strategic (S)</li>
<li>Learner (S)</li>
<li>Self-Assurance (I)</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be wondering about the letter after each (or the corresponding color above). Let me explain that first. The 34 strengths are grouped into 4 categories of themes, based on how they relate to leadership.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I” stands for “influencing”. My #1 strength and 2 more of my top strengths are related to influencing.</li>
<li>“S” stands for “strategic thinking”. A whopping 6 of my top strengths are related to strategic thinking.</li>
<li>“R” stands for “relationship building”. <strong>Connectedness</strong> is my top strength related to relationship building and <strong>Individualization</strong> (not pictured) is my second highest.</li>
<li>“E” stands for “executing”. <strong>Belief</strong> and <strong>Responsibility</strong> (not pictured) are my top strengths related to execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>With all that explained, what is the overall summary of my top strengths, and what do they say about the way I best approach life?</p>
<h3 id="strategic-thinking-is-a-major-theme"><em>Strategic Thinking</em> is a major theme</h3>
<p>There are 8 themes related to <em>Strategic Thinking</em>, and they dominate my top strengths.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>If you know me at all, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that I&rsquo;m continually learning, collecting insights, sifting through information to find the signals in the noise, clarifying situations, engaging in deep conversations, imagining possible futures, brainstorming, asking tough questions, analyzing paths of possible success &amp; failure, and spending time in intentional reflection.</p>
<p>My <em>Strategic Thinking</em> strengths mean that I can be a major help when it comes to creating a vision, breaking new ground, developing new ideas, setting direction, focusing our attention on what matters, changing systems, and accounting for changing factors.</p>
<p>But there’s always a downside, right? With so many strengths related to <em>Strategic Thinking</em>, there is a chance that nothing comes of all that thinking. Analysis paralysis. Theory without practice. Cheap talk.</p>
<p>All this strategic thinking needs to actually be <em>useful</em>.</p>
<h3 id="so-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it">So what are we going to do about it?</h3>
<p>We need an antidote for thought-without-action. Luckily, <strong>Activator</strong>, my #1 strength, is just what the doctor ordered! The <strong>Activator</strong> theme is precisely about turning thoughts into action.</p>
<p>Leading from this strength means I’m always looking at what’s next, bringing energy and excitement to it. Having a vision of a future is great, but it starts to become reality when I&rsquo;m spurring myself and others to actually get moving in that direction. I don’t leave important conversation without concrete next steps, even if those steps are small ones. Building on that excitement and momentum is key to getting change happening.</p>
<p><strong>Activator</strong>, combined with my <em>Strategic Thinking</em> strengths, means I&rsquo;m eager to actually test out theories and get rapid feedback. We can get real data to know if the approach needs to change, move full speed ahead, or be shelved to make room for something better. Innovative ideas plus rapid feedback cycles are how we evolve.</p>
<p>My so-far-unmentioned top talents also relate to <strong>Activator</strong>, too. With <strong>Connectedness</strong>, I am often bringing people together and sharing the broader picture, both of which helps people rally around the cause. <strong>Command</strong> and <strong>Self-Assurance</strong> mean people often look to me to make tough decisions in risky situations, reassure or inspire them, and help remove roadblocks &amp; barriers. These, too, help us make progress even with things are hard.</p>
<p>But again, there is a drawback to all this quick movement, motivation, and momentum. I can impatient and tough. I have to be careful not to set too high of standards or push too hard, or I risk burnout and hurting relationships. To counter this, I must repeatedly go back to the <em>Strategic Thinking</em> strengths: pushing hard <em>only</em> where it makes a big &amp; lasting difference, making sure we have time to recharge &amp; reflect, and adapting systems to make changes more sustainable.</p>

			 <p>Let’s consider these two opinions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>A business shouldn’t have to sell a cake (or pizza, or medicine) to someone whose personal choices they don’t agree with</li>
<li>Social media companies shouldn’t be able to kick people off their platform, even if when they promote violence</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re hearing from people who support both of these opinions at the same time. I’d like to briefly examine how this is the worst of four possible options.</p>
<p>Let’s look at each option:</p>
<h3 id="option-1-neither-cakes-nor-violence">Option 1: Neither Cakes nor Violence</h3>
<p>Private businesses are not required to serve anyone. This is internally consistent. You can choose to do what you want with your own property and business, so long as your aren’t infringing on others’ rights. This is the “default” mode for liberal democracy &amp; libertarianism.</p>
<h3 id="option-2-both-cakes-and-violence">Option 2: Both Cakes and Violence</h3>
<p>Private businesses are required to serve everyone. This is also internally consistent. This treats businesses like a public good rather than private asset. For things like social networks, that means they act more like a public utility than private business (and may even be state-run and state-owned). This is the “default” mode for social democracy &amp; state socialism.</p>
<h3 id="option-3-cakes-but-not-violence">Option 3: Cakes but not Violence</h3>
<p>Private businesses can’t choose who to serve based on who people innately are (or perhaps even based on what those users/customers believe), but they can otherwise reject service to those that break rules of the business or break rules that endanger the polity/society. This is the “default” mode in progressive democracy.</p>
<h3 id="option-4-violence-but-not-cakes">Option 4: Violence but not Cakes</h3>
<p>Private businesses can reject service to people based on identity, but may be required to provide service to those that are endangering others. This is the “default” mode of fascism.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer option 1 (with some additional safeguards/protections) over 3 over 2 over 4. But regardless of your preference for options 1 through 3, I hope it is clear that option 4 is the most inconsistent and dangerous of all of the positions.</p>

			 <p>Also, stop saying &ldquo;insurrection” and &ldquo;sedition”. Those imply they are taking a principled stance against authority &amp; power.</p>
<p>This is a violent tantrum. This is a coup. This is terrorism.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give it the dignity of “sedition” &amp; “insurrection”. It doesn&rsquo;t deserve it.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m already seeing memes going around about &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t they treat these terrorists at least as bad as they treated the civil rights protestors this summer?” And for good reason. The disparity is glaring.</p>
<p>But the difference isn&rsquo;t just that these folks are white. It&rsquo;s also because with civil rights and BLM protestors, the people in power <strong>didn&rsquo;t care about making martyrs</strong>, because there were already plenty who have died for the cause. The movements ignite and reignite based on these deaths, as the injustices continue.</p>
<p>Governments are more careful about making fascist martyrs, because it give the fascists a case to &ldquo;prove&rdquo; their persecution complex.</p>
<p>This is just another sick paradox of fascist problems.</p>

<hr>
<p>I love music. And though I listen to less than I used to (due to more meetings and more podcasts &amp; audiobooks) I still really enjoy listening to music when I can. I explore new sounds and visit old favorites. I play music for different moods &amp; contexts. I curate playlists with a unique style of sound. I still think of my music sometimes like I would when I was a DJ.</p>
<p>After Google killed yet again another one of their best products (Google Music) and replaced it with something worse (YouTube Music) I again started working on going back to the tried-and-true-but-takes-more-work method of owning and managing my own music.</p>
<p>I prefer to source my music from <a href="https://bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a>. I like Bandcamp because they seem to treat the artists better than other sites, and they allow you to manage and re-download or stream the music you have bought through Bandcamp. They also have many features for music discovery. On many Fridays throughout 2020, they removed their cut entirely and let the full purchase price go to the artist/label. I think they do this every once in a while even in non-awful years, too.</p>
<p>I also re-signed up for iTunes Match. Apple has somewhat hidden this service, because they want you to use their streaming service. However, it&rsquo;s still there (look under &ldquo;Features&rdquo; at the very bottom of the main iTunes store page) and is a nice option to make your library available on all your devices. It takes all your apple music, plus anything you have in your chosen music folder (e.g. from CD rips or Bandcamp purchases) and either matches it to the iTunes version of the song, or uploads a copy for your devices to use, if they don&rsquo;t think they have it. It costs much less than streaming services, too.</p>
<p>With this move, I also started &ldquo;scrobbling&rdquo; again. This is a method where you ping a scrobbling service with each song you play, and it keeps track of your listening stats. I use <a href="https://www.last.fm/">last.fm</a>, though there are other compatible services available. I didn&rsquo;t start scrobbling again until I was adjusting my setup during the year, so my numbers don&rsquo;t represent the full year. That said, I can at least see what I&rsquo;ve been listening to later in the year.</p>
<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I scrobbled 5653 plays, and my top genres according to <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams/listening-report/year">my last.fm report</a> were:</p>
<pre><code>- Industrial
- Electronic
- Metalcore
- Industrial Metal
- Rock
</code></pre>
<h3 id="artists">Artists</h3>
<p>I listened 1230 different artists! The top 10 were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Some of these top 10 could arguably even be smashed together. Argyle Park, Circle of Dust, and Celldweller are all bands from Klayton (aka Klay Scott aka Scott Albert). In addition, Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly is a prominent contributor (as producer, electronic musician, or remixer) to many of the Fear Factory albums &amp; songs that I listened to.</p>
<p>Most of the bands listed this year I&rsquo;ve listened to for years, but Seeming is new. I found Seeming on Bandcamp this year and and have been enjoying some of their catalog, especially their newest. On that front&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="albums">Albums</h3>
<p>I listened to 1819 different albums! The top ten were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The 4th one there is kind of a cheat, as it&rsquo;s really 3 Haste the Day albums re-issued in 1. Based on the counts, you can see there was really nothing that I listened to on repeat all year, but several of these albums had multiple playthroughs, as well as scrobbles from listening to my &ldquo;loved tracks&rdquo; automatic playlist.</p>
<p>I reviewed <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/01/of-the-month.html">NOENEMIES</a> and <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/02/03/of-the-month.html">Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes</a> earlier this year, and shared some thoughts and favorite tracks.</p>
<p>Igorrr is the undisputed king of wild genre mashups, and <em>Spirituality and Distortion</em> once again shows continued evolution in their art. In any given track you may find a combination of baroque music, metal, opera, electronic music, eastern musical styles, western music styles, hand-made instruments, and various other influences. <a href="https://youtu.be/YCqG9B8j-cI">Watch &amp; listen</a> to &ldquo;Downgrade Dessert&rdquo; for one of the more &ldquo;normal&rdquo; but amazing tracks on the album.</p>
<h3 id="tracks">Tracks</h3>
<p>I listened to 3917 different tracks! The top ten were:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>The top 3 tracks I definitely listened to on loop at some point in the year. Both  &ldquo;Computorr&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go Small&rdquo; could be theme songs for 2020.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Computorrr&rdquo; (<a href="https://drumcorps.bandcamp.com/album/computorr">listen</a>) is a gltchy, sample-filled, frenetic track that should have you dancing around and thinking about how technology works in our lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;TV got your brain&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I want to get online&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I <strong>need</strong> a computer&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We work with anybody else who&rsquo;s fighting the system&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Go Small&rdquo; (<a href="https://youtu.be/9Mo3euMRaro">watch &amp; listen</a>) is a simple, haunting, independent, somewhat-melodramatic track that evokes many feelings of the year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;when the world is drowned in flames
write something you can understand&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;the earth is radiantly suicidal
if there&rsquo;s any play in favor of survival, it&rsquo;s: <em>go small</em>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>What did you listen to this year? Any recommendations?.</p>

<hr>
<p>I read 23 nonfiction books this year, down from 31 last year. I attribute this to a tough year, and also reading more fiction as well as reading more from other sources. I read more overall this year than last.</p>
<p>I prefer to read nonfiction in ebook format, so that I can create highlights and notes and have them automatically export to <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a>, where I keep all my reading notes for review. I read through the notes when finishing a book, so that I can capture what I learned in my own words (an important part of learning &amp; synthesizing). I also have Readwise setup to surface 15 highlights from my reading every day (with a built-in “smart system” that follows my weighting choices based on source and recency of the work).</p>
<p>My first choice is to borrow the ebook from the local library, using <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Overdrive/Libby</a>. Then I can read in the Kindle (or Kindle app). If not available there, I try to buy it as epub, and open it in iBooks. Both Kindle and iBooks are supported by <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a>.</p>
<p>When I read a paper book, I buy my own (usually from <a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis">Bookshop.org</a> these days, to support independent bookstores) and underline text and write in the margins. Then I <em>also</em> add those to <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a> using the Readwise app and follow the same process I listed above. It just takes more time, which is why I prefer ebooks.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m not sure if a book is going to be relevant, high-quality, or have a lot of content that I want to highlight, I will listen to an audiobook, usually from <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Overdrive/Libby</a> again (though we have an Audible subscription as backup).</p>
<p>I have collected my 2020 recommendations (both fiction and nonfiction) on a <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/2020-recommendations-459efe07-b6bd-49eb-aef9-dccf011a914a">Bookshop list</a> for easy perusal. That, and all of the individual book links, are affiliate links.</p>

<p>I read 37 works of fiction this year. I enjoy reading fiction in a variety of formats: paper, audio, and ebook. A good narrator (such as James Marsters for the Dresden books) really makes an audiobook come alive.</p>
<p>I try to get my physical books via <a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis">Bookshop.org</a> to support independent sellers. If I cannot find directly there, my next search is on <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/?aff=resilient">Indiebound</a>, for the same reason. I have collected my 2020 recommendations (both fiction and nonfiction) on a <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/2020-recommendations-459efe07-b6bd-49eb-aef9-dccf011a914a">Bookshop list</a> for easy perusal. That, and all of the individual book links, are affiliate links.</p>
<p>For audiobooks and ebooks, I recommend checking your local library using <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Overdrive/Libby</a> to borrow the digital books. Many digital booksellers have not adopted a good way for us to pass on, resell, or share digital books like we can with physical books (despite it being easier), so I recommend supporting the library system first.</p>

<hr>
<p>Outside of work, I had several projects this year. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how different efforts turned out (or didn&rsquo;t):</p>
<h3 id="resilient">Resilient</h3>
<p>Resilient (<a href="https://resilient.substack.com/">here</a>) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open &amp; Secure) to share helpful &amp; meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: &ldquo;security, society, sustainability, and self.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively&hellip;it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word&hellip;but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.</p>
<p>So, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient">Resilient book collection</a>. I wrote about <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography">watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies</a>.  I made my <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> graph (notes) from <a href="https://owasp.org/">OWASP</a> and <a href="https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/">CSO50</a> conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.</p>
<p>I host <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/publish">Resilient</a> on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I&rsquo;m concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people&rsquo;s time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider. I offer a comped subscription to people that I know who sign up, and to anyone else who asks.</p>
<p>But I do think about the audience, the reach, and how often and how well I am delivering value to the audience. I&rsquo;ve not posted enough this year, and not done as much analysis as I would have liked. I keep wondering if I should kill the project and move the items into my general blog.</p>
<p>Yet I also know there are folks specifically wanting or asking for the kind of material that <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/publish">Resilient</a> provides, and it is the common theme of expertise in my life. So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!</p>
<h3 id="northern-fires">Northern Fires</h3>
<p>I started the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html">Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project</a> in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, <a href="https://www.silentplanetband.com/">Silent Planet</a>, has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song.</p>
<p>The idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica). I haven&rsquo;t found people that are interested in joining up, yet, so I&rsquo;ve spent less time on this than on other reading.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a shame I deprioritized this, because there are many lessons from the Spanish Civil War that are incredibly relevant to the world, today. I&rsquo;m going to pick up reading and writing for this project more in 2021, even if others aren&rsquo;t reading the works along with me. Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works.</p>
<h3 id="40-for-40">40 for 40</h3>
<p>I turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I&rsquo;d started collecting will probably make it into the next project&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="dearkiddos">DearKiddos</h3>
<p><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/">DearKiddos</a> was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church.</p>
<p>This one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don&rsquo;t get burnt out on the project.</p>
<h3 id="inktober">Inktober</h3>
<p>I had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/">a few entries and catch-up entries</a> which were frankly pretty bad&hellip;but I knew that going in. Though I wasn&rsquo;t consistent and didn&rsquo;t finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll do it in 2021, or not.</p>
<h3 id="home-office">Home Office</h3>
<p>My spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office. Since both of us are working from home full time now (and for a while still to come, it looks like), we converted that room to her office and the guest room to my office.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy with how my office is turning out, making it serene and suitable for focus. I installed two shelving units (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/11/07/like-many-i.html">including this one</a>).  I have one more item I&rsquo;m still trying to get from Ikea, and I hope to get a reading chair when it seems safe to go shopping for those, again, but otherwise it&rsquo;s been very good. I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="wet--wild">Wet &amp; Wild</h3>
<p>(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to call this.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access). I&rsquo;d like to have a place to camp and eventually build a cabin/cottage to our unique specifications. I want to preserve some of our ecology and plant some trees, maybe even re-wilding a space, depending on it&rsquo;s current state. I also see it as an investment when a lot of investments are problematic, these days.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found a few things that <em>sorta</em> work with our criteria (including one I need to investigate further), but nothing yet that has made us move on a purchase. I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open still in 2021, and am open to leads!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also been getting prepped to go camping more, which I miss quite a bit. I got my <a href="https://www.bioliteenergy.com/">Biolite</a> stoves tuned back up, am preparing to remediate my dad&rsquo;s old cooler (it has a crack in the internal lid), replaced our old tent, and got a cold weather sleeping bag.</p>

<p>I enjoy podcasts, particularly when doing chores, driving, or <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/30/114407.html">playing games</a>. Since podcasts compete for attention with audiobooks, they really have to be a cut above to earn a spot. In general, I&rsquo;d rather do the deep reading (incl. listening) with a book than have a superficial conversation about something in a podcast.</p>
<p>Before we go into the recommended podcasts, let me say a little about how I manage my feeds and listening. I am a happy <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> subscriber and highly recommend it. It syncs well across multiple devices, has a web listening portal, allows me to manage smart lists, and has configurable-but-reasonable settings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Overcast is a self-funded app that has sustainably succeeded on its merits and respected your <a href="https://overcast.fm/privacy">privacy</a> for the last 6 years.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OK, on to the podcasts that are making the cut:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vox.com/ezra-klein-show-podcast">The Ezra Klein Show</a> - This was my favorite &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; podcast this year. Ezra brings on a variety of guests, does the homework to understand his guests&rsquo; arguments, and pushes at the edges of their arguments. There&rsquo;s great, deep, respectful back and forth almost every episode. He recently announced he&rsquo;ll be leaving Vox (and this podcast) to go to the New York Times as a columnist and also host a new podcast.</li>
<li><a href="https://peterattiamd.com/podcast/">The Peter Attia Drive</a> - This is my favorite science &amp; health podcast, and I am a paid subscriber. I get immense value out of the detailed show notes, which often make their way into my <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a> highlights and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> graph (database).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.risky.biz/">Risky Business</a> - This is my favorite cybersecurity news &amp; analysis podcast. I don&rsquo;t often listen to the &ldquo;sponsored content&rdquo; (on principle), but even those are done pretty well, and they put them at the second half of the show so you can skip them after the news &amp; analysis.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.sceneonradio.org/">Scene On Radio</a> - This is my favorite documentary podcast. Each season goes deep on a topic. Season 4 was &ldquo;The Land That Never Has Been Yet&rdquo;, investigating the USA&rsquo;s history as a democracy.</li>
<li><a href="https://longnow.org/seminars/podcast/">The Long Now</a> - Two podcasts (&ldquo;Long Now Seminars&rdquo; and &ldquo;Conversations at <em>The Interval</em>&rdquo;) present a variety of topics related to long-term and strategic thinking, something we desperately need in an era of distraction, social media, ambient advertising, and quarterly reporting.</li>
<li><a href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/">The Knowledge Project</a> - This is an interview podcast with &ldquo;great minds&rdquo;. Some of the episodes are full of difficult questions and helpful insights, while some of the other episodes are more like fan interviews full of confirmation, hindsight, and success bias. The host does not generally interrogate the objectives of success, so there can be conversations that are about how to be more successful at doing the wrong or harmful thing. Yet, there&rsquo;s still enough good here that I stick around for the great moments and insights. I recommend you combine this with something that causes you to think about the purpose and impact of strategies, too (Like Ezra Klein or Long Now, mentioned above).</li>
<li><a href="https://rebelsteps.com/">Rebel Steps</a> - This is a podcast that helps people understand and get started with political organizing and direct action. I think we all need a source that makes sure we are thinking about the people marginalized in our societies.</li>

<p>In addition to traditional newspapers &amp; news magazines (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/31/news-magazines-review.html">see that list here</a>) I get some of my news via feed or newsletter. I send both to <a href="https://www.inoreader.com/">Inoreader</a>.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with feeds &amp; feed readers, the basic idea is that instead of having to go and check a bunch of sites periodically for updates, you can list the ones that you like, and <em>have those items come to you</em>. Feed readers often add other functionality, too. For Inoreader, I like the ability to take in normal (RSS) feeds as well as newsletters and Twitter accounts. It also has filtering rules, so I can use criteria to hide or highlight certain items.</p>
<p>The net result is I don&rsquo;t have to wait for those things to hit my inbox nor do I feel the urge to obsessively check sites &amp; social media. I can just periodically open up Inoreader and check them <em>on my schedule</em> instead of having the schedule dictated to me.</p>
<p>I check my feeds about once a day, see which items are worth my attention, and either read them directly if short, or export them to <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> if they are longer or worthy of highlights. My highlights go to <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a>, where I keep all my reading notes for review.</p>

<p>This examen helped me clear up my feeds list by removing a lot of inactive or broken feeds, and also removing ones that I don&rsquo;t read very often. It also made clear that I need to diversify my authors list.</p>

<h3 id="newspapers-and-news-magazines">Newspapers and News Magazines</h3>
<p>I tend to prefer &ldquo;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_media">slow news</a>&rdquo;, focusing on quality over quantity &amp; speed. Most &ldquo;breaking news&rdquo; (or even daily news) I don&rsquo;t need to hear about, and the net effect of rapid-fire news is to introduce more interruptions and unnecessary stress into our lives. I also try to mix both broad (global) perspectives and local reporting.</p>
<p>I reserve most news reading for Saturday mornings, where I usually peruse the following sources, reading just the articles that are relevant to me or challenging to my perspective:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.economist.com/">The Economist weekly magazine</a> - This is a very high-quality global-perspective news magazine, though a bit limited in topics of focus. I often read from the app, exporting articles to <a href="https://app.getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> that I want to highlight or annotate, so that they enter <a href="https://readwise.io/i/todd54">Readwise</a>, where I keep all my reading notes for review. If I have errands to run before I get through reading, I switch to listening to the articles.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us">The Guardian (US edition) weekly news magazine</a> - This is another high quality global-perspective news magazine, and will often hit the important topics that would not have made it to <em>The Economist</em>. I get the actual physical edition of this, only. The puzzles at the back are a nice bonus.</li>
<li><a href="https://anabaptistworld.org/">Anabaptist World</a> - This year, <em>The Mennonite</em> and <em>Mennonite World Review</em> merged to become this news magazine. It&rsquo;s published triweekly or so (16 issues a year), and covers various USA and global <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/28/yr-mennonite.html">anabaptist</a> news and commentary.</li>
<li><a href="https://indianapolisrecorder.com/">The Indianapolis Recorder</a> - This is my local news and the best source in Indianapolis. Even though it is labeled with the purpose of continuing to &ldquo;support and empower African Americans&rdquo;, it has the broadest and best reporting for <em>all</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.slow-journalism.com/">Delayed Gratification</a> - This is a quarterly news magazine that looks back over the quarter. Though I love the idea of this one, and they create a beautiful product, I will probably be dropping it when it is renewal time, as the topics tend to be a bit too pop for my tastes.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="other-magazines">Other Magazines</h3>
<p>On the &ldquo;not news&rdquo; front, I enjoy a few other magazines. All of these are no (or almost no) advertising. This is important to me, as ad-free means the subscription price represents the truer cost of the writing, doesn&rsquo;t prejudice the editorial stance of the magazine, and helps free the writing to do much more than &ldquo;get a reaction&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.plough.com/">Plough Quarterly</a> - this is another Anabaptist magazine. It is published by the <a href="https://www.bruderhof.com/">Bruderhof</a> (rather than Mennonites), and has a broader scope &amp; appeal and is not just for Anabaptists. It has both current and historical essays and material.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.newphilosopher.com">New Philosopher</a> - a high-quality magazine, with each issue being like a symposium on a certain philosophical topic or question.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/">Offscreen</a> - a physical product for digital people. This magazine brings humanity to technology. (<em>warning: this one does have supporter ads, but they are minimal and minimalist.</em>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ernestjournal.co.uk/ernest">Ernest</a> - I just started reading this one after learning about it from <a href="https://micro.blog/adders">@adders</a>. It&rsquo;s a beautiful journal of adventure.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Doing this examen helped me to cull a handful of magazines that I&rsquo;ve not been reading much.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/31/feeds-newsletters-review.html">In the next post (here)</a>, I will cover Feeds (RSS, etc.) and Newsletters that I subscribe to.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not someone who typically reads many comics. But this year, a couple things had me reading more.</p>
<p>After having had <a href="https://imagecomics.com/comics/list/series/saga/collected-editions">Saga</a> recommended multiple times, I started the series, and enjoyed the first couple volumes.</p>
<p>Second, after learning about the &ldquo;complete marvel reading order&rdquo; <a href="https://skalchemist.blogspot.com/2020/03/my-experience-reading-all-marvel-comics.html">from a friend</a>, I signed up for <a href="https://www.marvel.com/unlimited">Marvel Unlimited</a> and setup a &ldquo;just the essentials&rdquo; <a href="https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/comic_box.php">comic box</a> on CMRO and started going through the key classics. I saw the introduction of the Fantastic Four, Ant Man, The Hulk, Thor, Spider Man, and some others. My favorite of the early comics ended up being the <a href="https://www.marvel.com/comics/series/2080/tales_to_astonish_1959_-_1968">Tales to Astonish</a> series, which often included an Ant Man short comic, a couple other short comics, and a two page story. I also read the <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781506708119">Alien 3 comic adaption</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, I read 25 comics this year.</p>
<p>What comics did you read this year? Any recommendations?</p>

<p>As you may already know, I enjoy <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/games/">games</a>. Especially ones with a social element, or where we get to create some sort of emergent story together. In the year of the pandemic, a lot of traditional card and board games were harder to play (unless you took them digital or used tabletop simulation software).</p>
<h3 id="pandemic-gaming">Pandemic Gaming</h3>
<p>For a handful of pandemic get-togethers, we played some <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/party-pack/">Jackbox Party Pack</a> games over <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>. Ones I particularly enjoyed include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/bidiots/">Bidiots</a>: where you create &ldquo;fine art&rdquo; and then bid on art at auction</li>
<li><a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/party-pack-six/">Push the Button</a>: where you have to figure out who the aliens are on the ship</li>
</ul>
<p>On that note, <a href="https://among-us.io/">Among Us</a> became another hit this year, with not too dissimilar play. I played this with some groups online, as well.</p>
<p>At home, we played some classic Hand &amp; Foot, a rummy-like game where you have two hands (a <em>hand</em> and a <em>foot</em>, get it?). I&rsquo;d link to rules, but like many of these classic card games, it seems like every family has their own version, and ours doesn&rsquo;t match the varieties I&rsquo;ve seen online.</p>
<h3 id="role-playing-games">Role-Playing Games</h3>
<p>On the role-playing games front, I played a variety of things this year, as online games continued to work well. We typically play online with just a video conferencing tool and then <a href="https://rolz.org/">Rolz</a> for our chat &amp; rolling.</p>
<p>My local game participated in a playtest for <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/burningwheel/torchbearer-2nd-edition/">Torchbearer 2nd Edition</a>. Torchbearer and <a href="http://www.mouseguard.net/book/role-playing-game/">Mouse Guard</a> are a tight version of the <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com">Burning Wheel</a> engine. I had not played very much of Torchbearer 1st edition, because our group is often playing different kinds of adventures than what it was best suited for. But 2nd edition is honing many things and introducing tools to facilitate more types of playstyles. I&rsquo;m very excited about what <a href="https://twitter.com/burning_luke">Luke</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/Mimir9">Thor</a> have created and am looking forward to this release. (Watch for our names in the credits!)</p>
<p>When the playtest was over, we took our setting (<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mauragaaqtuq-new/the-story/characters">Mauragaaqtuq</a>) back to core <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com">Burning Wheel</a>, starting our 4th game in the setting (the 4 being: a long BW campaign, a one-shot LARP, the TB playtest campaign, and now another BW campaign). I&rsquo;m really impressed by the richness that the players (aided by system components such as Wises, Circles, and Beliefs) have added to the setting. We just started Season 2 of <a href="https://forums.burningwheel.com/t/mauragaaqtuq-murder-of-crows-season-2/23623/3">Mauragaaqtuq: Murder of Crows</a>.</p>
<p>My already-online game group with friends from Puerto Rico and Chicago (which also got our start years ago, playing Burning Wheel in the Wheel of Time setting&hellip;.yes, of course we called it &ldquo;Burning Wheel of Time&rdquo;) has tried a few things this year.</p>
<p>First, we had a game set in <a href="https://portal.esteren.org/en">Shadows of Esteren</a> but using the <a href="https://www.arcana-games.com/bloodandbone">Blood &amp; Bone</a> system. This was tough, as we were trying to simplify and not do a lot of homework, but it was tough to do in practice. The game engine took a lot of nods from things that worked in other games, but IMO failed to deliver them as a cohesive set.</p>
<p>Next, we went on to playing a fantasy-historical game set in a mythic version of Tyre. We used the hidden gem of a game engine <a href="http://dominionrules.org/">Dominion Rules</a>, with some added house rules. This is my favorite open source game, and still feel like it has a lot of potential many years after its release. Alas, this did not last as there was some COVID burnout.</p>
<p>Now, we are on to something new&hellip;err old. We&rsquo;re using <a href="https://palladium-store.com/1001/category/Palladium-Fantasy-RPG.html">Palladium</a> 1st edition and engaging classic dungeon-delving in a published module. Palladium Fantasy is new to me (though I&rsquo;ve done a little <a href="https://palladium-store.com/1001/Rifts-Categories.html">Rifting</a> back in the day), and I&rsquo;m not big on the &ldquo;old school&rdquo; nostalgia (partially because &ldquo;old school&rdquo; for me isn&rsquo;t Palladium and original D&amp;D but West End Games&rsquo; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_The_Roleplaying_Game">Star Wars</a>, and partially because the &ldquo;scene&rdquo; is rife with miscreants and vice-signalling), but I&rsquo;m having fun because the group is fun and I&rsquo;m leaning into the randomness and weirdness of the setting and system.</p>
<p>Over break, I got to play the <a href="https://riverhorse.eu/jim-hensons-labyrinth-the-adventure-game/">Labyrinth Adventure Game</a> with my niece and nephew, and this was a blast. It&rsquo;s a beautifully produced product with a simple system &amp; great scenes that offer a lot of replayability for zany adventures to get back things stolen by the Goblin King. In contrast to many RPGs, there is plenty of excitement and adventure without having to focus on fighting.</p>
<p>As for live action games (or LARPs), those were mostly cancelled this year (and for good reason), but some communities continued to get together in chat and audio events. I played in a handful of these events on Discord, with my <a href="http://www.owbn.net/">One World by Night</a> main character, but obviously it is not the same.</p>
<h3 id="video-games">Video Games</h3>
<p>I tend to play non-twitchy open world-type games. This is both so that I can listen to podcasts or audiobooks while I play, and because I don&rsquo;t need the adrenaline from twitchy games. (I get enough of that working in cybersecurity, TYVM.)</p>
<p>As in years past, most of my video game time was spent in the Bethesdaverse (e.g. <a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/">Elder Scrolls</a> and <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/">Fallout</a> games, particularly, the &ldquo;online&rdquo; varieties this year) and the <a href="https://borderlands.com/">Borderlands</a> franchise. I&rsquo;m mostly on <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/">Elder Scrolls Online</a> recently (add me for Mac/PC/Stadia: @groten), as I&rsquo;ve got some family and friends who are playing, too.</p>
<p>I played some <a href="http://www.disgaea.us/">Disgaea</a> as well, and though I love this game, the menus and repetitive motion mean that I can&rsquo;t play very much at a time without sore hands/wrists, so I end up quitting before getting through the postgame fun. I hope they will come up with some improvements on that for future games.</p>
<hr>
<p>What did you play this year? Any recommendations?</p>

<hr>
<p>When it comes to screens, I prefer to do something that requires engagement from me. Thus, when I&rsquo;m in front of a screen for enjoyment, I&rsquo;m often reading or playing. When I&rsquo;m watching, I prefer something humorous, challenging, or both. I generally don&rsquo;t like passive entertainment.</p>
<p>With the diffusion of shows and movies across streaming services (and Netflix &amp; Apple TV not playing nice together), I started using [JustWatch] (<a href="https://www.justwatch.com/">https://www.justwatch.com/</a>) to track &ldquo;to watch&rdquo; lists. JustWatch let&rsquo;s me have a single watch list, and go to wherever I can stream (or rent or buy) the show or movie.</p>
<p>This year, I continued my quixotic quest to &ldquo;watch all the sketch comedy&rdquo;. Here are some of the new (to me) ones I that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show">A Black Lady Sketch Show</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81036255">The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81087498">Astronomy Club</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We like to watch &ldquo;funny news&rdquo; at our house. My favorites are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>: the in-depth segments cut deep but also discuss opportunities to do something about it.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931">Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj</a>: a little less what-can-you-do-about-it and a little more in-depth. These could be heavy, which is probably why it&rsquo;s now cancelled.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>: I would occasionally watch the previous night&rsquo;s intro portion of this show while having my breakfast. I find Colbert (&amp; his writers) to be the funniest of the late night hosts. Also, lately, the moments where you can hear his wife (or their interactions) are charming.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>:  Like the above, it was an occasional morning watch of the intro portion of the show. He pulled no punches on calling out problems in the USA presidential administration, to the point where I&rsquo;m frankly surprised he&rsquo;s been able to stay on the air.</li>
</ul>
<p>At our house, we also enjoy some murder mysteries and &ldquo;police procedurals&rdquo;. Here are the couple that stood out for me this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/endeavour/">Endeavour</a>: It&rsquo;s Inspector Morse when he was younger, and they do a brilliant job of creating the setting of each episode (which is really a movie): visually, historically, and audibly.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80216172">Criminal</a>: the premise of these series  is that it&rsquo;s a very sparse set of the interview rooms and a couple hallways, yet they are able to do so much with it. ( <em>note: check for 4 different countries and languages; there are multiple versions with different stories</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are other shows that I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy">Ted Lasso</a>: this is my <strong>top recommendation</strong> from this year. On top of being very funny, I appreciate how much maturity and humanity people show each other, even in the face of most of the characters going through something incredibly difficult.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p">The Repair Shop</a>: this is an incredibly charming show about a shop where people bring in their antiques, family heirlooms, and broken items to be reconditioned. It&rsquo;s a brilliant spot of light in a throwaway consumerist culture, and there are wonderful moments of joy.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place">The Good Place</a>: a hilarious show that introduces and mashes up a lot of philosophical concepts and questions</li>
<li><a href="https://www.hbo.com/watchmen">Watchmen</a>: full disclosure, I hadn&rsquo;t seen the movie or read the comics before watching this spinoff TV show, but am familiar with their basic story line and themes. This was an incredible production that explores a number of both contemporary and timeless problems.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo">Fargo</a>: like Watchmen, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I am riveted to every season of this show. What I like most about this show is the juxtapositions: beauty &amp; horror, fortune &amp; reversal, education &amp; gallows humor, and much more.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD">The Mandalorian</a>: yes, it&rsquo;s full of fan service, but it&rsquo;s <em>really well-done fan service</em> that re-explores many tropes in fresh ways.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK">The Boys</a>: these comedy-horror comic book characters made it to TV, and it presents a scathing critique of various power structures.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)">Community</a>: I wrapped up this series this year. It&rsquo;s intelligent and funny, but you really do have to watch from the beginning in order to understand the characters and their dynamic. Troy &amp; Abed will always have a special place in my heart for the way they portrayed nerdiness in a more authentic and <em>laughing-with</em> rather than <em>laughing-at</em> way.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.history.com/shows/alone">Alone</a>: I generally shy away from &ldquo;Reality Shows&rdquo; due to vapidity, repetition, and manufactured melodrama. I will often check out survival shows, though (hey, Eagle Scout here!).  What I like about this one compared to some others is that you can see how they setup for the long haul, giving us a chance to see how challenges and priorities shift over the duration of their stay. (Of course, it&rsquo;s also relevant to my theme of <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/">Resilience</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Big Screen: I didn&rsquo;t watch a lot of movies this year (who did?), but here are the two that stuck with me:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out">Knives Out</a>: as I mentioned earlier, we enjoy murder mysteries in this house. This was a great twist on those tropes. (I feel like it&rsquo;s this generation&rsquo;s <em>Clue</em>)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film)">El Hoyo (The Platform)</a>: this minimalist dystopian horror film offers several critiques of the current age.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>What did you watch this year? Any recommendations?</p>

			 <p>📚 Finished Reading: <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781940939230">An Unintentional Accomplice</a></em>  by Carolyn L. Baker ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><em>Note: I received a free pdf of this book, with the agreement to provide a review when complete.</em></p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>: people who like autobiographies and who want to pursue racial justice</p>
<p>Gabrielle David, African American woman and publisher of 2Leaf Press, gave guidance to the author and also wrote the introduction. Here is David in the introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some would suggest that it is the systems that are broken. But none of these systems are broken; it is white people who are broken, but they do not have to be. And broken is not evil. Broken means it can be fixed. Healed. Changed. And recently, quite a few white people are stepping up to acknowledge, repair, and heal. This is what Baker has set out to do, to understand a complicated American structure that holds us all hostage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The systems, it turns out, are working as designed. Our unexamined assumptions, intentions, and practices need to be re-evaluated, and then we can work together to design systems with better outcomes for all.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>After the introduction, Baker takes us through the phases of her life, chapter by chapter. Along the way, she examines the ways that she may have benefited from white privilege, and the ways she may have allowed or perpetuated racial injustices. This, in reference to the title, is her being <strong>an accomplice</strong>. Each chapter is a vignette of her growing awareness of those challenges, and grappling with her thought patterns around them.</p>
<p>One of the interesting angles to Baker’s reflections is that it is clear that throughout her life she has been socially-conscious in many ways, and has spent much of her life serving others. Yet, as Baker shares, that doesn’t mean one gets everything right. This is a useful reminder for all of us.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>In the main part of the book you will not find many concrete actions to take in order to fight injustice. This is understandable, as it is a work of self-reflection. However, for those who are looking for ways to respond to the book, Baker has provided a couple resources.</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Baker often cites many of the works that helped her along her journey. These are helpfully collected in a bibliography, one which would make a great reading list for people who don’t otherwise know where to start.</p>
<p>Second, an <strong>Anti-Racist Checklist</strong> follows the main text. This is Baker’s own list of how she is exploring her responses to racial injustices. Many of these may be helpful to white people who are looking to turn their reflection into action.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>While I would normally prefer a different systematic approach (academic, treatise, essay, etc.) to topics such as this, it was refreshing to read a personal perspective that was both thoughtful and did not make the author out to be a savior, villain, or villain-turned-savior.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>
<p>I was reading this article today from <em>the Economist</em>: <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights">“No Vaccine for Cruelty”</a> (<a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg">image</a>).</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.</p>
<p>The article says &ldquo;no vaccine&rdquo;, but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let&rsquo;s give this a shot.</p>
<h2 id="how-authoritarians-rise">How authoritarians rise</h2>
<p>First, by &ldquo;authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They&rsquo;re sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they&rsquo;re almost always men) or tyrants.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make everyone afraid</li>
<li>Blame someone for it</li>
<li>Claim to be the savior</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that&rsquo;s the vaccine!).</p>
<h2 id="make-everyone-afraid">Make everyone afraid</h2>
<p>There are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that&rsquo;s genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!</p>
<p>As you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even <strong>caused</strong> by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to <strong>do something</strong>, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>
<p>First, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by <strong>being</strong> hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. <em>Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?</em></p>
<p>Another way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (<em>sorry, that’s the topic for another post</em>), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is the original source of this information?</li>
<li>Is this mostly facts or opinions?</li>
<li>Is this showing things in only the worst way?</li>
<li>Who are they trying to scare?</li>
<li>Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (<em>Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>There will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.</p>
<h2 id="blame-someone-for-it">Blame someone for it</h2>
<p>The next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called &ldquo;scapegoating&rdquo; or setting up a &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It&rsquo;s a sad way to create fake togetherness. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on <em>hope</em> was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)</p>
<p>Now, it&rsquo;s true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He&rsquo;s trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>
<p>One thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us. We can live in neighborhoods where there are people with different backgrounds. We can go to schools where everybody doesn&rsquo;t look like us. We can make friends with people with different experiences than us. When we travel, we can learn from and be respectful to the people that are local to the area. We can be part of groups and activities where we meet people who think or act differently. Here&rsquo;s why: when you know people that are in the accused group, it&rsquo;s hard for someone to convince you that they are the enemy, because you&rsquo;ll be able to see that the lies and stereotypes aren&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p>Also, along the lines of <em>hope</em> from phase 1, we can build teams, support, and organizations that serve people and solve problems. When we&rsquo;re used to doing work to make the world a better place, we know that problem-solving is rarely an us-vs-them situation, it&rsquo;s usually something where diversity actually helps in finding new solutions!</p>
<p><em>What other ideas do you have for protecting us against the hateful blame game?</em></p>
<h2 id="claim-to-be-the-savior">Claim to be the savior</h2>
<p>At this point, the cycle of blame and fear has ramped up, because the blaming has created more division and fueled fear further. Now the strongman makes the claim to be the savior. They tell you &ldquo;look, I know what the problems are&hellip;I warned you about them&rdquo; (back when they made people afraid) and &ldquo;I know how to solve it&hellip;I told you who is at fault&rdquo; (back when they blamed people). See what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>
<p>They will tell you they are the only one smart enough to see it all, and strong enough to do something about it. They will often use the language of &ldquo;law &amp; order&rdquo;, meaning that they will wield power, control, and even violence over the groups that they setup to take the blame.</p>
<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along, you&rsquo;re probably noticing that the strongman isn&rsquo;t really following tradition &amp; law, and is actually creating disorder or at least adding to it. You&rsquo;re right, the claim to “law &amp; order” is a lie, but that doesn&rsquo;t really register for the people who are already afraid and bought into the blame game. That means the best way to defend against phase 3 here is to defend against phase 1 and phase 2, as we discussed above.</p>
<p>That said, if you&rsquo;re a person of faith (or even if you&rsquo;re not!), you should be wary of anyone who claims they&rsquo;re the only solution to your problems. It&rsquo;s healthy to be a bit cautious (&ldquo;skeptical&rdquo;) of power, and one of the things we can do ahead of time is to build our organizations and institutions in ways where power is shared among more people.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Authoritarians are seizing more power around the world right now, and it will likely happen again in your lifetime. But when you and your community practice some of these defenses, you can help limit the times it will happen, and lessen the damage that comes when it does.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve looked for some patterns, of course. Many of them are cosmopolitan places (or at least one of the most cosmopolitan places in their state). Many of them have college towns. Many of them are tech forward. But none of these factors is universally true across them. What do you notice?</p>

<p>The barren wastes, bearing down on me.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Cracks in the clouds leave me wondering: Did the oceans dry out and return to the sky, for a privileged perspective of our final goodbye?</p>

<p>When the ocean fills our veins and the soil becomes my bones:<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> Maybe we&rsquo;ll fall asleep tonight to the madness in the melody poured out for slaves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe we&rsquo;ll fall asleep tonight to the madness in the melody poured out for slaves. Maybe this storm is a perfect score for wretched bodies washed ashore, poured out for me.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Huberman notes that to attain significant brain rewiring requires that you induce a sense of “urgency” that leads to the release of norepinephrine. This hormone, however, will make you feel “agitated,” like you need to get up and go do something. It’s here that you must apply intense focus to fight that urge, ultimately leading to the release of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that in combination with the norepinephrine can induce brain growth.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-these">What are these?</h2>
<p>These regions are “watersheds” or “drainage baisins”. They represent an area where all the water drains into one body (stream, river, lake, etc.).</p>
<p>In the USA, the numbers you see in the above images represent the 8-digit “HUC” or Hydrologic Unit Code. From my example, 05120201 represents Ohio (05), Wabash (12), Patoka-White (02), Upper White (01). As you can see, they are all named after the major river(s) of that region.</p>
<p>In addition to the 8-digit HUCs, there are also 12-digit HUCs, representing two additional layers of zoom-in and specificity. Using my proposed naming above, perhaps we could call these <em>Townships</em> and <em>Neighborhoods</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-mine">What are mine?</h2>
<p>In the USA, you can find your regions by progressively zooming in <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/wsc/watershed_finder.html">via this tool from the US Geological Survey</a>. For each region, they also provide many linked resources.</p>
<p>To get even more specific, you can check your 12-digit HUC <a href="https://mywaterway.epa.gov/community">using the community water search from the EPA</a>. This is also a great resource to see the quality of the water in your area, including the safety of swimming in it, the health of aquatic life in it, and the quality of your drinking water.</p>
<p>(<em>Note: if you live outside the USA, please feel free to share in the comments how to look up watersheds where you live!)</em></p>
<h2 id="why-does-it-matter">Why does it matter?</h2>
<p>As the saying goes: <em>water is life</em>. People, wildlife, and the entire ecology within a watershed are all part of the same stream of life.</p>
<p>In addition, ecological health is tied to financial health, and both are affected by community interactions and governance within the region. Their fate flows together.</p>
<p>Thus, the thought experiment of using the terms: <em>Nation, State, County, City, Township, Neighborhood</em>.</p>
<p>Political boundaries can often feel arbitrary, based on agreements or impositions that may have had very little to do with the people that actually live in the area (or were even contrary to their interests, such as in colonial situations).</p>
<p>But watersheds are based on shared life. Regardless of wealth, ethnicity, or other factors, people within a watershed have shared destiny.</p>
<h2 id="so-what">So what?</h2>
<p>What would it mean to think of our local watershed as our polity, our political unit?</p>
<p>Could we become better at seeing our neighbors as people in the same boat, rather than as enemies?</p>
<p>Could we more readily identify how systems are interacting?</p>
<p>Could it enable more long-term thinking, strategic thinking, thinking that considers not just the current moment but the impact to the financial, social, and ecological health of the region?</p>
<p>How is the health of your watershed? What might you do, knowing that?</p>

			 <p><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>
<p>I had someone ask me today how I advanced in my career so quickly.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to share those answers with you, but first, some points up front:</p>
<ul>
<li>“advancing&quot; is not the most important standard of your career: it&rsquo;s more important to look at the impacts (both good and bad) that are the results of our work</li>
<li>maybe we should say &ldquo;vocation&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;career&rdquo; because you might choose to do non-traditional work or do important-but-unpaid services (maybe that&rsquo;s another topic!)</li>
<li>I was pretty lucky to grow up in a situation where I didn&rsquo;t have major health or safety troubles, never lacked access to educational resources, and wasn&rsquo;t treated like an outsider: we call this &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; and it means it was easier for me to get going in my career (and other things were easier as well!)</li>
</ul>
<p>With that said, here&rsquo;s an edit of what I shared with that person, today:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many specialists who are very good at one thing, and many generalists who are ok at a lot of things, but one of the best ways to make a big and unique impact is to <strong>combine two <em>different</em> types of things that you are good at</strong>. This is where most inventions, breakthroughs, and changes come. It&rsquo;s also where what&rsquo;s special about you will shine.</li>
<li>In order to learn about what those special things could be for you: <strong>stay curious</strong>. Learn a little bit about a variety of things, explore the world in the ways that you can, experiment &amp; practice in areas where you are excited to try more, and listen (better: ask!) for specifics when people compliment you.</li>
<li>When things get hard: <strong>welcome the challenge</strong>. Unless it&rsquo;s actively harmful for you or others, challenges are where you will grow the fastest: in understanding, in confidence, and in skill. It&rsquo;s how to build up experience more quickly. But you only grow if you dive into the challenge instead of avoiding it!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hopefully one or more of these tips will be helpful for you.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>
<p>In a democracy (of almost any kind), one of the most basic ideas is that people have a voice in what happens to themselves and the group. (By “voice”, I mean they have some say in what happens.) This does not always work out perfectly, but it is much better than not having a voice at all!</p>
<p>One of the common ways that people have a voice in democracy is by voting. There are many ways of voting, and some ways are better than others (maybe we can talk about that some other time!). But one thing that is true across different types of voting is that people are allowed to vote, as an important way to use that voice.</p>
<p>Because of that, we should <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/09/03/covid-19-and-an-atmosphere-of-distrust-pose-grave-risks-to-americas-election">be aware when people try to limit people’s ability to vote</a>. If somebody is trying to make it so that others don’t have a voice, it is a warning sign. We usually call it “voter suppression”, meaning that votes are stopped or “suppressed”.  People might try to stop others from voting for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>they think their own voice is more important than others</li>
<li>they think that democracy is not the right way to run things for the group</li>
<li>they want to hold unfair power over others</li>
<li>they are afraid things will change from what they are used to</li>
</ul>
<p>Often, it could be more than one of those reasons!</p>
<p>There are many ways that people try to stop others from voting, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>making it cost money to vote: either directly (like a tax/fee) or indirectly (like needing to spend money or miss work to travel to vote or to send in your vote)</li>
<li>making it confusing to vote: with complex voting systems, disinformation (meaning: spreading lies about voting or about the details &amp; options for the vote), or by changing the rules</li>
<li>limiting voting options: by places available, the times allowed to vote, and what even is allowed to show up on the voting list</li>
<li>limiting who can vote: by age, race, gender, or some other status in the voting group</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes, people even make it so that the voting system itself helps some groups or areas more than others (examples of this are “electoral colleges”, “gerrymandering”, and “two-party systems”, in case you want to look those up).</p>
<p>So, if a vote is coming up, and you see a group trying to limit who can vote, consider why they are doing that. What do they have to gain? Why don’t they respect the voices of the people they don’t want to vote? Can I help the people that won’t get to vote? What can we change to make it so more people are allowed to have a voice?</p>

<p>As you read these posts, you may disagree with me, and I hope you sometimes will! What’s important is that you think about the topic deeply, don’t fall for easy answers, and consider what it means to live a good life.</p>
<p>If you want to respond to any of these, I’d encourage you to write your own response and link back to what you are responding to. If you don’t know how to do that, or don’t want to, you can also email me, and I will respond. My email address is my first name and last initial at “hey.com”</p>

<p>Note: this is unfortunately reinforced by common creeds (e.g. Apostles). If we believe in Jesus, we have to go past who he <strong>is</strong> and look at what he <strong>did</strong>, including what he <strong>taught</strong>. Too much Christianity is taking the magic Jesus pill but not living into the kingdom.</p>

			 <p>Kicking off the reading for <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/northern-fires/">#NorthernFires</a>, we have to decide where to start. We need one that gives us the setting, background, and context of the song&rsquo;s topic: northern fires and the bombing of Guernica.</p>
<p>Three of <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/24/syllabus-northernfires.html">the books on the syllabus</a> pertain directly to the Spanish Civil War. One is fiction (<em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>), and one is very detailed (<em>The Spanish Civil War</em>). Thus, we land on  <em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143037651?aff=resilient">The Battle for Spain</a></em> as our introduction to the topic.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.antonybeevor.com/">Sir Antony James Beevor</a> is a military historian who is <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/search/book?keys=author%3ABeevor%2C%20Antony&amp;aff=resilient">no stranger to writing about battle and war</a>. Beevor himself served in military, which we will need to keep in mind as we read, as it affects the perspective he brings to the events.</p>
<h2 id="about-the-book">About the Book</h2>
<p>The English-language version of <em>The Battle for Spain</em> was published in 2006, on the 70th anniversary of the start of the war. It&rsquo;s a re-write and update of his 1982 text <em>The Spanish Civil War</em>. The Spanish-language version of this newer version won the &ldquo;La Vanguardia Prize for Non-Fiction&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="getting-going">Getting Going</h2>
<p>With that introduction completed, let&rsquo;s get going with reading this book as our introduction to the topic. I&rsquo;ll do a fast skimming read of the whole book, and then come back for some commentary.</p>
<p>If you want to really hone in on the northern fires and bombing of Guernica, you can head directly to pages 231 to 233 in the <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780143037651?aff=resilient">version we are reading</a> to get a quick and terrible glimpse of the events relevant to the song/topic.</p>
<p>I look forward to hearing your thoughts as we get into this book!</p>
<p><em>Note: if you&rsquo;re looking to find any of the books from our reading list, I created <a href="https://bookshop.org/lists/northern-fires-guernica">a bookshop list of them here</a>.</em></p>

			 <p><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593094136?aff=resilient">Imaginary Borders</a></em> by Xiuhtezcatl Martinez</p>
<p>⭐️⭐️⭐️, Recommended</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>
<p>The author is a talented <a href="https://xiuhtezcatl.com">hip-hop artist</a> and serves as Youth Director for <a href="https://www.earthguardians.org">Earth Guardians</a>. The book is part of Penguin&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/TPC/pocket-change-collective/">Pocket Change Collective</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-idea">The Idea</h2>
<p>Climate change is a challenge that effects not just the environment we live in, but is tied to our most important political and economic issues. It&rsquo;s going to be a lot cheaper to solve it now than try to address the damage, dangers, and losses as they continue to come. Taking action now means we can be more proactive, sustainable, and just in our approach. To do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve got to get creative</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve got to go beyond our artificial borders</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve got to listen to those who are impacted the worst</li>
</ul>
<p>We can do it.</p>
<h2 id="the-quotes">The Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the climate crisis is more like a fucked-up web that connects and impacts every single thing we care about. It amplifies all the existing problems we experience today, from racial injustice to economic inequality to health issues to food access to war. It affects our economies, our politics, and our cultures.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Wallace-Wells then went on to say that climate damages would create about $600 trillion in expenses by the end of the century. To put that in perspective, that’s twice as much as all the wealth in the world today. I caught myself laughing, thinking about all the people who say acting on climate is too expensive.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the most critical piece of this conversation: the deep need to create a cultural shift that includes people in every facet of society.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Systematic injustices of economic disparity and discriminatory city planning push communities of color to the greatest danger zones for flooding and superstorms.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The irony is that the nations discriminating against immigrants are the ones responsible for releasing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is creating the conditions that are causing more people to seek refuge.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It’s only fair that wealthier countries pay for cleaning up the climate mess that they’re mostly responsible for&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;more than eight million people die from air pollution every year&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;White people on average experience 17 percent less air pollution than they produce, while black and brown communities receive 61 percent more air pollution than their consumption habits create.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;All these <strong>imaginary borders</strong> exist in order to disempower us, and they keep our movements fragmented and divided. And it’s going to take us dropping these artificial barriers of partisan politics to really get down to solutions.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;one of the most damaging colonial legacies from a climate perspective is the illusion that we are separate from our environment.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Everything changes when the places we love are threatened.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;our society is heavily based on an economic model that is built on the exploitation of human and natural resources.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Climate solutions need to take economic justice into account because if we perpetuate the same old top-down systems, we won’t be able to solve our crisis holistically.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Currently, the US government is spending $649 billion annually to subsidize fossil fuels&hellip;.Redirecting the money the government is pouring into propping up the fossil fuel industry would more than finance the entire Just Transition of our energy economy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The story we’ve been telling about climate change has failed to truly evoke and inspire connection because it has lacked imagination and creativity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the climate crisis can inspire the best in humanity. It is challenging us to be our most creative, resilient, visionary selves.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Let me share some of my labels, or identities. Let me share some of my beliefs.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll note that I say &ldquo;in that order&rdquo;. That is because these have a priority ranking, since each flows from, and is beholden to, the above. Our means ultimately determine our ends.</p>
<h2 id="heading">✝️</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian, specifically, an <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/28/yr-mennonite.html">Anabaptist</a> Christian.</p>
<p>I believe that Jesus is the clearest revelation of the nature of God, and that the actions and sayings of Jesus in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synoptic_Gospels">synoptic gospels</a>, as well as the testimony of the early church in Acts &amp; Epistles, are relevant to us today. I believe that they help reveal God&rsquo;s love for humanity and the rest of creation.</p>
<p>I believe in creating hope, overcoming fear, and experiencing joy. I believe in looking for the image of God in everybody. I believe in second chances, healing, and liberation.</p>
<p>I believe that faith is not just a personal matter, but something to be wrestled with in a loving and supportive community. I believe group discernment, mutual aid, spiritual formation, grace, and consensus-based decision making are parts of a healthy faith community.</p>
<p>I understand that we don&rsquo;t know it all. I believe we should watch &amp; listen for God anyway, and be graceful to others along the way.</p>
<h2 id="heading-1">🕊</h2>
<p>I believe in pursuing peace. I believe in pursuing reconciliation, restoration, and redemption. I believe in caring for our communities, our <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography">watersheds</a>, and the earth.</p>
<p>I believe Jesus was serious about loving our neighbors, laying down our weapons, and not returning evil for evil. I believe in Jesus&rsquo;s call to use <a href="https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus%27%20Third%20Way.pdf">subversive tactics</a> to upend violent power without becoming like those we are opposing. I believe Jesus&rsquo;s calls to creative nonviolence are relevant to <em>all</em> who follow the Way.</p>
<p>I understand that peace does not always seem practical. I believe we should pursue it anyway, while also strategically working on the upstream problems that make peace seem impossible: economic &amp; racial injustice, environmental exploitation, miseducation, fearmongering &amp; scapegoating, criminalization, and war.</p>
<h2 id="heading-2">🏴</h2>
<p>I believe in decentralizing and democratizing power. I believe in respecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty">negative liberties</a>.</p>
<p>I believe in undoing the still-echoing harms of chattel slavery and abolishing forms of modern day slavery. I believe in dismantling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyriarchy">kyriarchy</a>. I believe in dismantling empire, colonization, occupation, borders, and racism. I believe in abolishing the school-to-prison pipeline, the prison-industrial complex, and in changing justice systems to focus on restoration rather than revenge. I believe in abolishing intellectual &ldquo;property&rdquo;, planned obsolescence, and restrictions on innovation, alteration, maintenance, and repair. I believe in dismantling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operation">CAFO farming</a>, the <a href="https://michaelpollan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/in_defense_excerpt.pdf">&ldquo;nutritional industrial complex&rdquo;</a>, food subsidies, and monocultures.</p>
<p>I understand that these goals are not accomplished overnight or maybe even in my lifetime. I believe we should pursue them anyway, building fair and just alternatives along the way.</p>
<h2 id="heading-3">🌹</h2>
<p>I believe in equity and fairness. I believe in listening to and amplifying the voices of the oppressed and marginalized.</p>
<p>I believe you can tell a lot about a person based on whether they defend the powerful or the powerless. I believe in sharing, cooperatives, mutual aid societies, unions, partnerships, and common purses. I believe in resisting advertising, addiction, and the attention economy. I believe in supporting underdogs and resisting monopolies. I believe that those who extract from people and the earth should pay their share of costs (e.g. for protection, legal, and infrastructure), and not be subsidized by the ones they are extracting from. I believe that abandoned properties may justly be reclaimed and restored by those willing to care for them. I believe in helping our neighbors. I believe in sharing over hoarding. I believe in working together.</p>
<p>I understand that equity is difficult when injustices still exist. I believe people with privilege should share that privilege, anyway, working towards a better future for all.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve started a series where we&rsquo;ll be examining the lyrics and source material for Silent Planet&rsquo;s <em>Northern Fires (Guernica)</em>. (See the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html">Series Introduction</a> if you missed it.)</p>
<p>Today, I want to share all the lyrics and annotations from the song, as well as links to which versions I&rsquo;ll be using for the references. You won&rsquo;t have to read everything I will be, but you may find you want to read some. Most of the referenced works are pretty heady, but they do include some great fiction, including <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em>, <em>Altered Carbon</em>, <em>1984</em>, and Margaret Atwood&rsquo;s <em>the Robber Bride</em>. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll want to join along with one or more of the works. But if you just want to read and comment on the posts, that&rsquo;s fine, too!</p>
<h2 id="the-lyrics">The Lyrics</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ration my breath - terror clandestine in my chest. Mangled, I lay on a foreign forest floor. [1] Caught in an instant, divided by distance. Alone in the fray, clutching my trigger I pray as I make amends with death on a distant shore. [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Such is the fate of the nation state [3]  despite the myths they propagate. [4] The narrative never fits the crime. Democracy’s died this death a thousand times. The masses kneel before the golden cross - held by the priest [5] who bows at the feet of the king. [6]
We stand alone in the dust of what could be, fighting to find our humanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Bury me with my name in an unmarked grave - another casualty to the vanity of history. [7] The war marches on after the killing ends. [8] Take our lives: Colonize our minds. [9]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been digging through timelines, historical bylines; I find the fatal flaw in our design lies between thoughts we had and words we knew [10] - between what we’re told and what is true. [11] Who fuels the fascist? [12] A classist - inculcating the masses in passes&hellip; under the contrived countenance of contrition. [13]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The victor writes the story [14] - more often burns the manuscript. Set fire to a pyre, cremate the crimes that they commit. [15] But the flames kept us warm, so we bit our tongues and tasted scorn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The bitter stench of finite men betrayed by the thieves they swore to pretend. The bell will toll [16] and in the end lay only echoes of what could have been. [17]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We stand alone in the dust of what could be, fighting to find our humanity. We stand alone in the dust of what could be; nothing we fought for will set us free. [18]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Throw myself, headlong, to the jaws of the beast: [19] The war machine that feeds for eternity.
Throw myself, headlong, to the jaws of the beast: The war machine that turns for eternity.
Throw myself, headlong, to the jaws of the beast: The war machine that feeds for eternity.
Throw myself, headlong, to the jaws of the beast: The war machine that turns for eternity.</p>

			 <p>This was our question in church this morning, and this was my response:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m thankful that the Lord of Flies is wrong. I&rsquo;m thankful that people predominantly want to help humanity, and that those that want to exploit it for their own wealth or ego are a minority. I&rsquo;m thankful that we see more people sharing food, advice, help, seeds, recipes, and tools than we see angry white doomsday preppers that are mad they didn&rsquo;t get to have apocalypse standoffs.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m thankful for coronavirus haircuts, quarantine beards, and hair colors returning, for long walks, sports-season-delays, and the absence of quarterly fast fashion dictates. I&rsquo;m even thankful for endless stories of sourdough-making and crafts projects. I&rsquo;m thankful for chats around dinner tables, in backyards, and on patios. I&rsquo;m thankful for swept porches, tended gardens, and home projects.</li>
<li>I pray that our global reprieve from advertising-based conspicuous consumption will persist, if even in some small degree. I pray that we will find ways to alter world economies towards circular movement and sustainability, instead of just-in-time supply chains and extractive growth. I pray that we will be able to spend more of our time and attention on the things that matter to our friends, family, and community, and less on activities and products that we are told we should want.</li>
<li>I hope that we continue to drive less and walk more, buy less and share more, throwaway less and repair more, consume less and create more, desire less and care more.</li>

<p>These are the opening words in Silent Planet’s - Northern Fires (Guernica), from the album <em>When the End Began</em>.</p>
<p>And thus begins a series where we’ll examine the lyrics and read through the annotations for this song.</p>
<p>“Wait, a song has annotations?” Yes! Silent Planet produces footnotes for their lyrics, citing influences and quotes. Northern Fires has 19! (You can read more about them in the <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/24/syllabus-northernfires.html">syllabus post</a>.)</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Wait, is that possible? How could one be both?</p>
<p>Let me propose these broad definitions for the terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conservative</em>: seeking to maintain that which is good</li>
<li><em>Progressive</em>: seeking to fix that which is bad</li>
</ul>
<p>You can probably see where I am going here: <em>these are not mutually exclusive</em>. In fact, they can be reinforcing of one another. Holding onto goodness provides a place of safety and strength from which to be able to pursue change. Addressing problems also frees up more people and more opportunities to pursue good.</p>
<p>Naturally, a larger question of &ldquo;ok, but what exactly is <em>good</em> and what is <em>bad</em>&rdquo; comes up; however, seeking clarity on this question is often muddied due to team loyalty at the expense of critical reflection. Breaking down that tribalism can improve our ability to discuss this topic more fruitfully.</p>
<p>There are also questions of strategy, tactics, immediacy, etc., different dimensions that are worthy of coverage in another post &amp; discussion.</p>
<p>I am not suggesting a &ldquo;but both sides&rdquo; false equivalency, but a broadening of perspective. Let&rsquo;s consider both the conservative &amp; progressive priorities: what we should cherish and what we should repair. We can do both.</p>

			 <p>I heard from someone yesterday who said they feel more included in meetings, now. Why? Because they are no longer the &ldquo;odd person out&rdquo; in meetings.</p>
<p>Have you ever had that happen, where you you call or video conference in to a meeting and all the others are in a conference room? You get left out of the conversation. There&rsquo;s table chatter you can&rsquo;t hear. All the voices aren&rsquo;t clear. People look at each other but not you.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s unfortunate that it took our current situation to remind us of this principle, but here is what our standard behavior for meetings should be:</p>
<p><strong>if you have one remote participant, setup the meeting for all to be remote participants</strong></p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t reserve a conference room. Have each participant join from their desks.</p>
<p>It establishes equity in the meeting, and makes sure that all can be seen, heard, and considered.</p>

			 <p>This is not another form letter from a company assuring you that we are taking care of things. Instead, this is a <em><strong>Resilient</strong></em> message, looking at the intersections of COVID-19 and the topics we usually explore here: <em>security</em>, <em>society</em>, <em>sustainability</em>, and <em>self</em>.</p>
<p>But before we get to that, let’s have the obligatory and important reminder. As readers of <em><strong>Resilient</strong></em>, you likely don’t need any reminders, but repeatedly getting the word out still helps to <em>flatten the curve</em> and helps ensure that we have enough healthcare resources available to people who need them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wear a mask over mouth <em>and</em> nose. Not ones with valves.</li>
<li>Wash those hands. With soap. All over.</li>
<li>Keep six feet away from other folks if you have to be out.</li>
<li>Limit your time in “shared breathing spaces” (indoors).</li>
<li>Work from home if you are able.</li>
<li>Cancel any upcoming travel that involves transit or groups.</li>
<li>If you have a fever or any possible symptoms, get tested.</li>
<li>Don’t touch your face, mouth, or ears with unclean hands.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for helping to slow the spread of the virus, and for helping to get more people through this safely.<br>
Don’t panic! Prepare and persevere.</p>
<h1 id="security">Security</h1>
<p>Business Continuity Plans (BCP) are getting stress-tested. Why? The first reason is that in some businesses or non-business organizations, operations are either having to halt, scale way down, or even scale way up. The second is that some organizations are moving to a great amount of work from home.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibility for BCP activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your info/documentation is up-to-date on contacts, including the fact that people may not have access to their work phone #s</li>
<li>Also check that you have contact info for those “jurisdictional” contacts outside your org (e.g. health, emergency services, city, county, state, etc.)</li>
<li>If you rely on teams that are engaged on a retainer basis to help during crisis, verify whether they still have capacity for you, due to the widespread nature of the event</li>
<li>As always, review any lessons you are learning along the way, so that you can create action plans to iteratively improve</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibilty supporting increased Remote Work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make a plan for how physical assets are leaving (and eventually returning) to your physical locations</li>
<li>If you’re not already operating on Zero Trust Networking principles, verify that critical systems require additional protection beyond requiring VPN for access (adding multifactor authentication and enhanced monitoring, for example)</li>
<li>Evaluate your ability to continue to protect the end-user devices that are connecting to your systems: Can you keep them updated? Do you have EDR (endpoint detection and response) capabilities fully deployed? Can you define a “good” device through NAC (network access control) rules and quarantine bad devices until they meet specifications?</li>
<li>If folks are accessing most of your systems through an online suite (such as O365, Zoho, or GSuite), evaluate those configurations towards security standards and make critical changes</li>
<li>Work with your monitoring teams (such as NOC and SOC) to re-evaluate your expectations around what are standard behaviors and what activities need to be reviewed and/or escalated</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="society">Society</h1>
<p>The safety measures we are taking will put extra strain on some segments of our society. Here are a few thoughts as we work through these times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid hoarding, so that those with great need still have access. This goes both for physical goods but also for consumption of services and manipulation of markets.</li>
<li>People are losing work and income during this time. Can you reach out to give or receive assistance? Maybe through a an organization you’re part of?</li>
<li>Are there people in your life that need to hear from you? Or who you need to check in with? Get a call or video chat going.</li>
<li>As organizations do away with <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/15/what-will-happen.html">BS, punitive, or unnecessary measures</a>, hold them accountable not to reinstate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a praying person, consider the following prayer. Even if you’re not, you may find the items to be good contemplative ideas to spur action and support:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who are merely inconvenienced</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those whose lives are at stake.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who have no risk factors</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those most vulnerable.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who have the luxury of working from home</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those who must choose between preserving their health or making their rent.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who have the flexibility to care for our children when their schools close</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those who have no options.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who have to cancel our trips</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those that have no safe place to go.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who are losing our margin money in the tumult of the economic market</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those who have no margin at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>May we who settle in for a quarantine at home</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember those who have no home.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As fear grips our country,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>let us choose love.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>During this time when we cannot physically wrap our arms around each other,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us yet find ways to be the loving embrace of God to our neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="sustainability">Sustainability</h1>
<p>As we reduce our commuting, travel, and trips around town, we have an opportunity to evaluate our behaviors, and see what habits might stick. This has the potential to reduce petroleum-based travel and move us towards renewables-based vehicles/transportation, better food-production ecosystems, and people-centered cities.</p>
<p>Here are some questions to ponder:</p>
<ul>
<li>For those of you working from home, could you continue to work from home after this is over? For at least a portion of the time?</li>
<li>Which meetings need to still exist? Which <em>of those</em> still need to be in person?</li>
<li>If you are going outside more to get out of the house, is this building up your inspiration and capacity for walking, biking, and other people-powered transport? Could this stretch the radius in which you opt to walk or bike instead of getting in a car?</li>
<li>Are there edifying and/or relaxing places that you&rsquo;d like to visit, which don’t require a plane trip?</li>
<li>If you order in, or drive through, can you avoid the plastic utensils and containers? Maybe bring/use your own?</li>
<li>Are you cooking more at home? Could you keep doing more of that? Are there local farmers you can support?</li>
<li>Have you had to give up how much meat you consume? Could you keep eating less meat and fewer animal products?</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="self">Self</h1>
<p>If you’re following the safety tips in the introduction, you are already doing an important part to help slow the spread and ensure that people will have access to medical care. The tips and questions in the <em>security</em>, <em>society</em>, and <em>sustainability</em> sections are not intended to cause panic, but rather present food for thought that could help make things better now and in the future.</p>
<p>Through the period of uncertainty, it’s important to continue to take care of yourself. Again, some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take your meds, cook good food, and stay on your plan</li>
<li>If you work with any kind of therapist(s), see if there are options for continuing that work, maybe through video</li>
<li>If you feel overwhelmed, call a crisis hotline if you need it (1-800-273-8255) or get help via services like betterhelp or talkspace</li>
<li>Talk to your loved ones and your communities of support (faith and service organizations, for example)</li>
<li>Get some exercise at home and take walks in open &amp; natural spaces</li>
<li>Give yourself grace when you feel down</li>
<li>Practice gratitude for the things that are going well</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you found this helpful.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><a href="https://flobots.bandcamp.com/album/noenemies">Flobots - NOENEMIES</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Flobots have created some of my favorite “protest songs” including <em>White Flag Warrior</em>, <em>Stand Up</em>, and <em>Handlebars</em>. Naturally, I wanted to check out their latest offering.</p>
<p>Flobots is MCs Brer Rabbit and Johnny 5, along with a host of musicians &amp; guests. I really appreciate the electric violin, which frequently shows up in various tracks. Songs tend to blend hip-hop, singalong, and political sensibilities. This album doesn’t disappoint. You’ll find yourself singing the choruses, headbanging to the raps, and probably looking up references in the lyrics.</p>
<p>Favorite Tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>5: Quarantine</li>
<li>6: American Dreams</li>
<li>7: Rattle the Cage</li>
<li>12: Voices of the Dead</li>
<li>14: Related</li>
<li>16: Sleeping Giant</li>
</ul>

			 <p>I started Cal Newport’s 📚 <em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781478930082?aff=resilient">Deep Work</a></em> and it has me pondering something.</p>
<p>As expected (since I really enjoyed <em><a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/02/16/digital-minimalism-reference.html">Digital Minimalism</a></em>), though I have just started, I am appreciating the book. However, his early focus on  productivity is concerning to me. Often, we think of productivity as the One True Measurement (TM) of success, and I’m not sure that’s right.</p>
<p>While effectiveness (towards whatever goal(s) you set) is important, it leaves out factors such as quality, value, repeatability, learning, etc. You could argue that we should build those into the measurements of productivity, but I’d argue we often don’t.</p>
<p>Perhaps my disagreement is due to me being philosophically less of a consequentialist and more of a deontologist or virtue ethicist. In my way of thinking, it’s better to do right with less immediate output than to crank out good output that may be short-sighted.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>
<p><em>edited to add: Cal addresses this a somewhat when he gets into &ldquo;busyness&rdquo; being a (bad) proxy for &ldquo;productivity&rdquo;.</em></p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve recently dug back into checking out and buying albums directly, rather than streaming. I&rsquo;m limiting myself to an album or couple EPs a month, up to what I might spend on streaming. I&rsquo;m going to share about my picks here, once a month. With that, here&rsquo;s the first album:</p>
<p><a href="https://moormother.bandcamp.com/album/analog-fluids-of-sonic-black-holes">Moor Mother - Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I first found out about this artist via <a href="https://rebelbeatradio.com/">The Rebel Beat</a> podcast. <em>Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes</em> is a smart and challenging album. It&rsquo;s genre, like much of my favorite music is: “ummm, yes?” and contains elements of hip hop, folk, spoken word, punk, electronic, noise, and more. This is not an <em>easy</em> listen, but it&rsquo;s a good one.</p>
<p>Favorite tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>3: After Images</li>
<li>6: Black Flight (feat. <a href="http://saulwilliams.com/">Saul Williams</a>)</li>
<li>11: Private Silence (feat. <a href="https://reefthelostcauze.bandcamp.com/">Reef The Lost Cauze</a>)</li>

			 <p>I was meeting with one of the folks that I mentor/coach today, and they started a great conversation around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai">ikigai</a>. That led to a question for me about some of my top values or principles in my work. Here are four that I discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enablement: I don&rsquo;t want to be a bottleneck. My aim is to equip and empower others through education, tools, patterns, etc. so that they can take on more responsibility and help us all be more successful.</li>
<li>Mutuality: Decisions should include the context &amp; perspectives of the stakeholders. Directly, if possible. I aim for win-win solutions.</li>
<li>Resilience: Solutions should account for issues of scalability, safety, and sustainability. We ought to design things such that they can adapt to change in graceful ways. Ideally, becoming stronger &amp; better as they do.</li>
<li>Authenticity: I want be be open &amp; direct without being a jerk. I aim to make it safe for people to be themselves, to speak up, and to do what&rsquo;s right.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s probably no surprise that these four are strongly-interrelated.</p>

			 <p><em>Note: This book came up in conversation recently, and I took a moment to move my review onto my current blog, with some minor changes. This review is from August 2017.</em></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780735213296?aff=resilient">The Benedict Option</a></em> by Rod Dreher ⭐️</p>
<p>This was an incredibly disappointing book. If you are looking for a better account of modern “Options”, read something from one of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Monasticism#">“new monastics”</a> or spend some time learning from an intentional Christian community (such as Catholic Worker houses, Reba Place Fellowship, Rutba House, the Simple Way community, the Bruderhof, or Hutterite communities).</p>
<p>Dreher&rsquo;s focus in this book is much less about saving faithful Christianity, and much more about saving Conservatism. He laments the fall of corrupt Christendom but doesn&rsquo;t appear to embrace  the subversive and loving alternative of the Kingdom of God. He struggles more for power &amp; control than mercy &amp; justice.</p>
<p>He seems obsessed with issues of sexuality, spending a great deal of the book talking about his personal perspectives on it, but doing little to engage actual scholarship on the topics. It far outweighs the time he spends on other topics, and he gives little attention to the life and teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>To underscore the point about his conservative priorities: Dreher spends time revering Mormonism and Orthodox Rabbinical Judaism over Christian traditions that aren&rsquo;t Orthodox/Catholic.</p>
<p>My specific alternative recommendation to reading this book: get a copy of <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780310326199?aff=resilient">Common Prayer: A Liturgy for Ordinary Radicals</a>, and start using it with your family, friends, small group, house church, and/or faith community.</p>
<p>Further recommended reading: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1997273410">this review</a> from an actual Benedictine Monk.</p>

Mostly an incredible conclusion to the story. Suffered from inconsistent portrayal of Egwene and Gawyn that went contrary to their character arcs. Rand parts also a little hokey with Mormon stuff.</p>

			 <p>When I&rsquo;m commuting, doing chores, taking a walk, or even playing open-world video games, I often listen to spoken word. Sometimes these are audiobooks, but the rest of the time it&rsquo;s podcasts.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to podcasts, and am a happy subscriber.</p>
<p>This year, I started my own Podcast and Newsletter, <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/">Resilient</a>. The frequency is low-volume while I find my bearings.
<em>Note: Resilient newsletter posts are free, but you do have to subscribe to get access to the podcasts. This is not expected to be a money-making endeavor for me, but I do want to limit the availability of the voice recordings to those who are truly interested. I charge the lowest price that Substack (my provider) allows and then add a hefty discount on top of that. If you would like a free gift subscription to the podcasts, please message me directly.</em></p>
<p>While I appreciate the idea of &ldquo;chatty&rdquo;, &ldquo;actual-play&rdquo;, and &ldquo;review&rdquo;-style podcasts, you won&rsquo;t find those here.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-podcasts">Recommended Podcasts</h2>
<ul>
<li>Code Switch: If you don&rsquo;t know what code switching is, you definitely need to listen to this. If you already do, you will likely enjoy the variety of topics and perspectives and the charming hosts.</li>
<li>Cyber: covering information security from the perspective you&rsquo;d expect of Motherboard/Vice</li>
<li>The Ezra Klein Show: this is my new favorite show, overtaking Farnam Street as the best <em>big ideas</em> podcast, due to having a perspective, better back-and-forth, and deeper-dives</li>
<li>Freakonomics Radio: granted, some of this is &ldquo;pop econ&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s entertaining and frequently has good investigative research or covers big ideas.</li>
<li>From Embers: this is a Canadian anarchist podcast that often covers indigenous rights and our climate catastrophe</li>
<li>Invisibilia: a charming and perspective-widening show from NPR</li>
<li>The Knowledge Project: this podcast is interviews with &ldquo;big thinkers&rdquo;. The interviews often wander, but there are almost always important takeaways or food for thought.</li>
<li>Long Now - Conversations at the Interval &amp; Seminars About Long-Term Thinking: the perspective of these podcasts is incredibly important, and the topics are often enlightening. They suffer a bit from being Silicon Valley focused, but are otherwise very good.</li>
<li>The Peter Attia Drive: deep dives on health, medicine, and longevity.</li>
<li>Note to Self: a philosophical take on technology trends.</li>
<li>Radiolab: entertaining, sometimes enlightening, and incredibly well-produced.</li>
<li>The Rebel Beat: a source for a wide variety of radical political music.</li>
<li>Rebel Steps: how-tos for people learning about organizing for direct action, solidarity, and mutual aid.</li>
<li>Risky Business: information security current events coverage, with excellent analysis. Skip the branded interviews</li>
<li>Scene on Radio: As you add this podcast, make sure you have your app setup to listen to a season in order. Seasons 2 &amp; 3 (&ldquo;Seeing White&rdquo; and &ldquo;Men&rdquo;, respectively) were excellent, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to season 4.</li>
<li>Sleepwalkers: in-depth discussion around the opportunities and risks of artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Wait Wait&hellip;Don&rsquo;t Tell Me!: a humorous weekly news quiz that you probably already know about.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I set a goal of reading 63 books in 2019, which was a 10% increase over 2019. I met this goal exactly. I have again increased my goal by 10% plan to read at least 70 books in 2020.</p>
<p>About half of the books I read (32, to be exact) were fiction. I tend to read from the sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, classics, and RPG categories. These are all categories that help explore ideas and/or history.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-read">How I Read</h2>
<p>I get my books multiple ways. If I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll like the book, I look for the audiobook or ebook in my <a href="https://www.scribd.com/g/6xggmi">Scribd subscription</a> and then <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a> (to borrow digitally from my local library). If it&rsquo;s a book I&rsquo;ll want to reread or lend, I order a hardback via <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/indie-bestsellers?aff=resilient">Indiebound</a> or <a href="https://www.alibris.com/">Alibris</a>. I only buy fiction ebooks if there are massive discounts on something I want and it&rsquo;s not already in Scribd. I use <a href="https://www.bookbub.com/">Bookbub</a> to watch for these discounts.</p>
<p>My book (and article) highlights and notes from all sources go automatically into <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise.io</a>, where I review 15 highlights each day to aid in retention and reflection. This is one of the ways I start my day, and it&rsquo;s incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>I rate books between ⭐️ and ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, with ⭐️⭐️⭐️ being the cutoff for a worthy book. Thus, I will only share about the ⭐️⭐️⭐️ through ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ books, here.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I set a goal of reading 63 books in 2019, which was a 10% increase over 2019. I met this goal exactly. I have again increased my goal by 10% and plan to read at least 70 books in 2020.</p>
<p>About half of the books I read (31, to be exact) were non-fiction. I seek books that may be  &ldquo;eye-opening&rdquo;: those that challenge my understanding, worldview, and conceptions. I look for books of criticism, history, philosophy, ethics, theology, psychology, business, economics, and politics.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-read">How I Read</h2>
<p>For nonfiction, I get the books multiple ways. If I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;ll like it and don&rsquo;t expect I&rsquo;ll need to take a lot of notes, I look for the audiobook or summary first in my <a href="https://www.scribd.com/g/6xggmi">Scribd subscription</a> and then <a href="https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/">Libby</a> (to borrow digitally from my local library). If I know I&rsquo;ll want to reference the book a lot after finishing it, I order a hardback via <a href="https://www.indiebound.org/indie-bestsellers?aff=resilient">Indiebound</a> or <a href="https://www.alibris.com/">Alibris</a>. If I expect to learn a lot and/or take lots of highlights and notes, I&rsquo;ll borrow the ebook via Libby or buy it from an ebook seller.</p>
<p>My book (and article) highlights and notes from all sources go automatically into <a href="https://readwise.io/">Readwise.io</a>, where I review 15 highlights each day to aid in retention and reflection. This is one of the ways I start my day, and it&rsquo;s incredibly valuable.</p>
<p>I rate books between ⭐️ and ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, with ⭐️⭐️⭐️ being the cutoff for a worthy book. Thus, I will only share about the ⭐️⭐️⭐️ through ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ books, here.</p>
<h2 id="recommended-books">Recommended Books</h2>
<h3 id="heading">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525509288?aff=resilient">How To Be An Antiracist</a></em> by Ibram X. Kendi: it&rsquo;s rare for me to give 5 stars to anything, but Kendi did an excellent job sharing complex and important perspectives in an informative and actionable way.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="heading-1">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</h3>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525536512?aff=resilient">Digital Minimalism</a></em> by Cal Newport: Highly recommended book exploring how you can focus your digital time on the things that matter most. Unlike many minimalism-focused works, Newport goes into great detail in what to do with the space &amp; time that you free up. My full review/reference (as well as links to my experiment and a podcast I recorded for Resilient) are found <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/02/16/digital-minimalism-reference.html">here</a>.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780399590504?aff=resilient">Educated</a></em> by Tara Westover: an incredible memoir of someone who grew up in an abusive, anti-intellectual, conspiratorial home environment without any real schooling (home or otherwise) and went on to earn a prestigious PhD.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781594204227?aff=resilient">How to Change Your Mind</a></em> by Michael Pollan: an informative book about psychedelics and their applications in medicine.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780316478526?aff=resilient">Talking to Strangers</a></em> by Malcolm Gladwell: incredible narratives and insights of how things can go wrong when we talk to strangers, along with some (admittedly light) recommendations on how we can change structures and systems to do better.</li>
<li><em><a href="https://www.offscreenmag.com/">Offscreen</a></em> edited by Kai Brach: I read issues 17 through 19 of this large print-only magazine in 2019, and often found value in the interviews, perspectives, and recommendations. &ldquo;Offscreen is an independent print magazine that examines how we shape technology and how technology shapes us. &quot;</li>
<li><em><a href="https://mousebookclub.com/products/justice-series">Southern Horrors</a></em> by Ida B. Wells: this classic and important work is a reminder of how fear, power, and violence were (and still are) wielded to subjugate people.</li>

<li><em><a href="https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780679745402?aff=resilient">Technopoly</a></em> by Neil Postman: a book of criticism that asks more questions than it is prepared to answer, but still an incredibly important work to grapple with.

<p>This book is mostly useful narratives that introduce the factors that affect habits. It also includes a short “how-to” on changing habits.</p>
<h1 id="some-insights">Some Insights</h1>
<ul>
<li>Individuals have habits, organizations have routines</li>
<li>Keystone habits are great for building other habits and producing momentum through repeated small wins</li>
<li><em>Keeping a food journal</em>, <em>making your bed</em>, and <em>working out</em> are all habits which have many seemingly-unrelated positive impacts on your life</li>
<li>“Willpower” is stronger when people feel agency or impact</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-change-your-habits">How to Change Your Habits</h1>
<h2 id="identify-the-routine">Identify the routine</h2>
<p>Figure out what your habit loop is so that you can work to supplant it with another.</p>
<h2 id="experiment-with-rewards">Experiment with rewards</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try altering variables like a scientist, in order to see which reward you were actually seeking, and which you might like</li>
<li>Jot down the things that come to mind with each test; this helps with awareness and attention</li>
<li>Use 15 minute waits/alerts to help with elimination and analysis</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="isolate-the-cue">Isolate the cue</h2>
<p>Each time you experience the feeling, write down answers to the following:</p>
<pre><code>1. Where are you?
2. What time is it?
3. What is your emotional state?
4. Who else is around?
5. What action preceded the urge?
</code></pre>
<h2 id="have-a-plan">Have a plan</h2>
<p>Write it like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>When I see <strong>cue</strong> i will do <strong>routine</strong> in order to get <strong>reward</strong></li>
<li>This is your <strong>implementation intention</strong> and should be explicitly stated</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h1>
<p>Application instructions were very short and only covered in the appendix. For more detailed application notes, read <em>Atomic Habits</em>. I am finishing my read and review of that book, and will link it here when complete.</p>

			 <p>I recently <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/11/26/from-an-rpg.html">shared pictures</a> from an RPG I ran for my niece and nephew during thanksgiving week.</p>
<p>I tried running [Dungeon World](<a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/108028/Dungeon-World">https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/108028/Dungeon-World</a> ?affiliate_I’d=21283) for them last year, which was a bit too tricky of a rule set for them at the time. This time, I decided to start with <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/203657/Risus-Companion?affiliate_id=21283">Risus</a>, a very simple system that uses ratings called “clichés”.</p>
<p>Since we play Team Fortress 2 as a way to hangout and talk, we decided to set the game in the TF2 setting and use the TF2 classes (scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy) as our clichés. Having this pick list gave them enough, but not too much, variety to choose from.</p>
<p>I used a semi-standard Risus setup of starting ratings at 4, 3, 2, 1 (for the total of 10). I also told them their agency would give them 1 basic weapon and 1 tool, or 4 tools. They both chose the first option. (Maybe I should have made it 5 tools, as it didn’t seem like a hard choice but for them.) They also picked code names and their “real names”.  I encouraged them not to have the same things as each other in 3 and 4. Their characters started off like this:</p>
<p><strong>Codename</strong>: Z7
<strong>Real name</strong>: Megan
<strong>4</strong>: Engineer
<strong>3</strong>: Scout
<strong>2</strong>: Spy
<strong>1</strong>: Heavy
<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: shotgun
<strong>Tool</strong>: Wrench</p>
<p><strong>Codename</strong>: H6
<strong>Real name</strong>: Jace
<strong>4</strong>: Heavy
<strong>3</strong>: Pyro
<strong>2</strong>: Scout
<strong>1</strong>: Sniper
<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: rifle
<strong>Tool</strong>: binoculars</p>
<p>We didn’t have enough d6s, so I used d10s. I also used the Risus variant where you look at the <em>best</em> die in the roll, instead of the total. To play, when they wanted to do something interesting with an uncertain outcome, I asked them to describe it, told them which of their cliches was appropriate, and gave them a difficulty between 6 and 10.  I also brought in the Risus conflict rules, again using versus instead of totals.</p>
<p>I also brought in “bennies” to the system, in order to give us a little more flexibility. I awarded them 1 at the start of their mission, and told them they’d get another any time I thought they did something really interesting or clever. They could give me a bennie when they failed a roll and wanted to re-roll it. However, when I got a bennie from then, I could put it back in the pool to add a twist to the story. (In retrospect, I could have instead set it up where I “pay” it to whoever was affected by the twist, but this gets complicated when it could affect both of them.)</p>
<p>I did one more piece of prep. I marked up a pile of note cards with “standard exits” at each cardinal direction and various paths connecting them.</p>
<p>To play, I asked them to pick a card (from a face down spread). I added some more rough drawings to this card to turn it into their headquarters for their agency (which they decided was called the “Adventurers Agency”).</p>
<p>They were given their mission: to shut down the Mann Co factory that was producing robots that were being created and sent out to take over the city. They were also warned that some of the robots had been designed to look like humans! They were able to requisition a little more equipment, based on the mission. They ended up with a stun stick (with 3 charges), 1 stick of dynamite, and x-ray googles that could look through a nearby surface and maybe detect false robots.</p>
<p>The rest of it played out through the story. When they traveled “off a card” on our map, I had them pull a random card to place in that direction they went, and I added a few more light details to that section of the map that was being built out. I had decided at the beginning which one would represent the final factory, but of course I provided a lot of challenges to them along the way.</p>
<p>The finale was when they ended up using the stick of dynamite to disable the power supply for the plant. We had a lot of fun, and they keep asking to do another mission!</p>
<p>I’m happy to answer any questions about how I setup or ran this!</p>

			 <p>It was back to Games on Demand, again. <a href="http://www.mileszs.com/">Miles</a> and I got to try out <a href="https://questingbeast.itch.io/maze-rats">Maze Rats</a>. I confess I have avoided a lot of the “OSR” space due to encountering so much toxic behavior from that community. That said, this was a simple and fun game, and I may add it to my toolbox along with new-school old-school games like <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/christian-mehrstam/whitehack-second-edition-notebook/hardcover/product-22269088.html">Whitehack</a>, <a href="https://www.torchbearerrpg.com/">Torchbearer</a>, and <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/240583/Vagabonds-of-Dyfed">Vagabonds of Dyfed</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>We also got to try out another card-based RPG. I’m always eager to try these, because I love cards and have been tossing around ideas for my own game for years. <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/246744/Capers-Rpg?src=hottest_filtered">Capers</a> is a dual-named game because in it you play both supers (<em>caped</em>, get it?) and are involved in prohibition era-capers.</p>
<p>We had a pretty inexperienced (I think?) GM, so I’m not sure I got a good shake of this game, but I learned enough about how it’s setup to see what I liked and didn’t.</p>
<hr>
<p>Saturday was also the day I got the David Peterson AKA <a href="https://twitter.com/mouseguard">Mouse Guard</a> commission of our beloved dog Siku!</p>

			 <p>I started today off with some <a href="https://www.indiegamesondemand.org">Games on Demand</a>, and <a href="http://www.mileszs.com">Miles</a>, Christian, and I got to try the Penthouse playset with a couple others. It was epic in both the funny and horrible ways that Fiasco should be. Fiasco at GenCon seems to now be an annual thing for Miles and me.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then, it was time for our <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madjay/by-aecers-light">Aecer’s Light</a> Burning Wheel game with <a href="https://twitter.com/MadJayZero">Mad Jay</a>.

<p>I got a chance to swing by the Burning Wheel Headquarters booth and see David Peterson (AKA <a href="https://twitter.com/mouseguard">Mouse Guard</a>) in action, working on the piece I commissioned. That was quite the treat, and I’m really excited about how it is going to turn out!</p>
<hr>
<p>I also found a good-condition used physical copy of the <a href="https://ogc.rpglibrary.org/index.php?title=OpenD6">D6 System</a> book, which you may recognize as the core rules that powered West End Games Star Wars (and other games).</p>
<hr>
<p>The day ended with a fun dinner with friends. Looking forward to another great day at #GenCon19</p>

			 <p>I started GenCon off right by going to the gym before opening ceremonies! <a href="https://youtu.be/eaIvk1cSyG8">I am happy of myself</a>!</p>
<p>When the expo hall opened, I made a straight line to the BWHQ booth, as has become my tradition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Checked to see if there are any play tests this year (more on that, later)</li>
<li>Picked up an (additional) copy of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/burningwheel/miseries-and-misfortunes-les-fruits-malheureux">Miseries &amp; Misfortunes</a>, to supplement the Kickstarter</li>
<li>Got the small zine game  <a href="https://sagelt.itch.io/catch-the-devil">Catch the Devil</a></li>
<li>Most excitedly, I commissioned a toned paper sketch from David Peterson AKA <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/mouseguard">Mouse Guard</a></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.indiepressrevolution.com/">Indie Press Revolution</a> is always a good booth to check out physical RPG products. Bonus: they email you a copy of the digital book when you buy physical. I found some great stuff:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’m a fan of the Vampire the Masquerade product line (before problems with 5th edition and their catering to abusers and the alt right, anyway). I’d been wanting <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/225322/V20-Becketts-Jyhad-Diary">Beckett’s Jyhad Diary</a> for a while, but held off due to cost. IPR had a nice sale, so I got a copy.</li>
<li>Also on the Vampire front, they had physical copies of the <a href="https://www.drivethrucards.com/product/223907/Princes-Gambit-Card-Game">Prince’s Gambit</a>. This is another type of game I’m always up for: parlor/social-deduction game.</li>
<li>I also grabbed <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1940008275/companions-talean-epic-game-of-map-making-and-stor">Companions’ Tale</a>, because it’s a mapmaking and collaborative storytelling game. I like the idea of examining what version of the stories live, too.</li>
<li>IPR also had physical decks for the small LARP <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/201891/Winterhorn">Winterhorn</a>, which is a game where you play the regime trying to stop peace &amp; justice activists. Understandably, this is an educational LARP which can help to threat-model our own activism efforts, examining how we might be more resilient and effective.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also swung by <a href="http://posthumanstudios.com">Posthuman Studios</a>, and picked up my Kickstarter version of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/507486226/eclipse-phase-second-edition">Eclipse Phase 2nd Ed</a>. As usual, these folks were really cool to chat with at the booth.</p>
<p>Our coupon book had a free copy of Dwar7s Duel so I had to grab that, because Dwarves. It looks to be a simpler version of <a href="https://www.vesuviusmedia.com/games/dwar7s-fall">Dwar7s Fall</a>, maybe?</p>
<p>And finally, I couldn’t let a GenCon go buy without my customary <a href="http://timidmonsters.com">Timid Monster</a>. These are very cool and I have a little stand for them in my office.</p>
<hr>
<p>After the expo hall, I enjoyed a hilarious game of <a href="https://gshowitt.itch.io/goblin-quest">Goblin Quest</a>  with <a href="http://www.mileszs.com">Miles</a> at <a href="https://www.indiegamesondemand.org">Games on Demand</a>, my favorite place to try cool RPGs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Up next was the update panel from <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/beliefs-and-instincts/">Burning Wheel Headquarters</a>. We heard about what’s going on with the Burning Wheel universe. In summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Torchbearer 2 has a ton of revisions, they’re very excited about it, and they’re looking at how they can get some great playtesting and feedback before publishing</li>
<li>Miseries &amp; Misfortunes is going to start having some setting, scenario, &amp; lifepath expansions because the 5 years in Paris (1648-1652) is concurrent with interesting things happening in many other places in the world (and is apparently called “the general crisis” by some historians)</li>
<li>The “secret playtest” we did at #GenCon2018 has had more playtests, and much of the design work is complete, but i’ts been a bit on the back burner as other projects have taken front stage (and the challenging parts of component, art, etc. production have come up)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Tonight, I’ll be joining a big game of <a href="https://www.torchbearerrpg.com">Torchbearer</a> that got coordinated via the <a href="https://forums.burningwheel.com">Burning Wheel forums</a>.</p>

			 <p>Clever idea:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I started a “stress note” in my Notes app where I keep a list of whatever I’m anxious about. Anytime I add something new I reread my past worries and if they no longer matter (which is usually the case), instead of deleting them I apply the strikethrough style. There is something very calming and self-affirming in doing this, and as the list grows I actually find it very beautiful to look at.</p>

<p>We started our final delegate session by discussing the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0">Churchwide Statement on the Abuse of Child Migrants</a>, including the changes that had been made to the draft. There was a short time for Q&amp;A, in which several folks urged for stronger language in parts, or more details on next steps. MCC and others will continue to help with materials for going forward.</p>
<p>The vote for the resolution passed with only 2 dissenting (of 495). One of those two dissented because they wanted a stronger resolution.</p>
<hr>
<p>We received reports from the Step Up program, and three amazing representatives from the program.</p>
<p>We also got an update on the <a href="http://voicestogetherhymnal.org">Voices Together</a> hymnal project, which is expected to be ready in fall 2020.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our final discussion around our <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JF-_-DRAFT-Document-V3.pdf">Renewed Commitments</a> was for the third item: <em>Experience Transformation</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“How have you experienced the transformation of the Holy Spirit in your life? How might that inform the transformation of our shared life as a church?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At my table, we had a joyous moment of thanks and blessing from a retired (and now volunteer) pastor. I asked him a little bit about how he came to see such beauty and hope in change, even as some struggle with it.</p>
<p>He shared the following wisdom:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My first rule is: you’re not in charge anymore.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Second rule: give only blessings. Let others do the critique.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It’s about letting go, letting God. Trust the Sprit of God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He commented on why some folks struggle with change:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It has do with fear, and thus wanting to be in control. People who can’t let go are unhappy.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also had all-group Q&amp;A, again, with many great comments. One person reminded us that sometimes the Spirit moves <strong>in spite of us</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Our final worship session had Executive Director Glen Guyton as speaker&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;and he kicked it off by singing his rendition of Nirvana’s <em>Come as You Are</em> with the worship band.</p>
<p>(Believe me, I’ll add video here, if they release it. <em>Update: <a href="https://youtu.be/aqQ8UQ4E8Gk?t=60">here&rsquo;s the video!</a></em>)</p>
<p>Glen reminded us over and over that “God is Bigger”.</p>
<ul>
<li>God is bigger than our documents</li>
<li>God is bigger than our issues</li>
<li>God is even bigger than the Bible</li>
</ul>
<p>He repeatedly gave us the call to #BRINGTHEPEACE, and even reminded us of his own background:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was an officer in the military &amp; now I&rsquo;m part of a historic peace church, so don’t tell me your message doesn&rsquo;t work”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Glen’s charge for us is to “put some action to our words”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What are you going to do to #bringthepeace after you leave?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We again had two delegate sessions today, with us now moving into more of the “business” for the week.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, the resolution committee brought forward a new resolution that was generated this week: <strong>Churchwide Statement on the Abuse of Child Migrants</strong>. The drafters of the resolution received help from Iglesia Menonita Hispana, delegates, and the resolutions committee. It has the support of the Executive board and sufficient delegate signatures to be brought to the delegates.</p>
<p>As the resolution was read to the delegates, it ended with a standing ovation. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0">You can read the text here.</a></p>
<hr>
<p>We had another equipping study with Tom Yoder Neufeld. This time, we continued into chapters 4-6 of Ephesians, and how we live in God’s blessing.</p>
<p>Tom tells us:</p>
<ul>
<li>We do not walk alone</li>
<li>God walks with us</li>
<li>We walk with others</li>
<li>The unity of the Spirit is the <em>basis</em> not the <em>result</em> of walking together well</li>
</ul>
<p>And we exhibit the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Humility</li>
<li>Patience</li>
<li>Suffering each other (forbearance)</li>
<li>Forgiveness (gracing each other as God has graced us)</li>
<li>Seeing the face of God in each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the wording and imagery of the text, Tom imagines us as “chain gang of peace”, trying to run together, like in the poster for <em>O Brother Where Art Thou?</em>
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>We should be patient “seventy times seven”, but if bonds break, it should be with “grief” not “good riddance.”</p>
<p>Tom reminds us that “the unity of the Spirit is bigger, wider, and deeper than any of our organizational structures.”</p>
<p>In Q&amp;A, we were reminded that the pain is often on the party in the margins or minority. But we need to put the greater burden on the side with power, not the other way around.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, we discussed the proposal to formally add youth delegates (aged 16-21). This would include 1 per congregation, 2 per conference, and 2 per racial-ethnic constituency group.</p>
<p>It was clarified that current delegates can come from this age group, but that this codifies adding some specifically of that age range.</p>
<p>The measure passed nearly-unanimously with only 6 of 495 delegates dissenting.</p>
<p>I interviewed one of those dissenting, later. They were not against youth being delegates, only the way it was being implemented (as additional count and bylaw changes). They were afraid it cemented that youth are separate and different, rather than integrating them more. They would have preferred we simply passed a resolution granting Step Up members voting status.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the afternoon session, we discussed the leadership discernment slate. The Gifts Discernment team worked to fill roles at least 50% women, and at least 20% people of color. The slate had 48% women and 40% people of color.</p>
<p>After reviewing <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nominee-info-and-pics-for-KC-2019.pdf">the slate</a>, they were approved unanimously.</p>
<hr>
<p>Glen Guyton presented the plan for a new communications strategy. It would focus on a unified identity-building communications approach for MCUSA. It would also include <em>The Mennonite</em> going independent from MCUSA and joining <em>Mennonite World Review</em>.</p>
<p>I personally expressed concerns about how <em>The Mennonite</em> needing to become financially self-sustainable could lead to commercialization and the related negative effects that commercialization has on news. From Glen’s response, it sounds like those factors are being considered.</p>
<hr>
<p>In addition to the youth delegate changes to the bylaws, we also reviewed the other adjustments to the bylaws, <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf">which you can read here</a>.</p>
<p>These changes (including removing a reference to telegram!) were passed unanimously.</p>
<hr>
<p>Next, Michael Danner led a discussion on the membership guidelines, so that the executive board could get a sense of how our constituencies are feeling about handling membership guidelines.</p>
<p>We were asked to score both how important amending the guidelines is to our constituencies, and then how much energy we have to put into it over the next two years.</p>
<p>They also asked for our comments. Several comments from my table and others mentioned that the <a href="https://www.bmclgbt.org/">Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests</a> and <a href="http://www.pinkmenno.org/">Pink Menno</a> have people willing to advise on the process and wording for the guidelines. This would help limit some of the effort and pain that might otherwise have to be played out in local churches. As we discussed above, we want less of the burden to fall on those with less power.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both worship services today focused on the movement of the Spirit, a topic that may have felt uncomfortable for some Mennonites. But the Energy, the Breath, the Wind blew through our worship space, surprising us with new things.</p>

<p>Thursday’s Delegate Agenda:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Tom Yoder Neufeld continued to teach with us, today. He started by expressing thanks for the corrective and affirming feedback he received from yesterday’s session, reminding us that receiving such is a good sign of mutual discernment.</p>
<p>His theme was “Unity of the Spirit - body and temple” based on Ephesians 4:3</p>
<blockquote>
<p>making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the <strong>chain</strong> of peace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tom used the literal translation of “chain” for what might normally listed as “bond” because it’s an appropriate reminder that chains are for things that come apart. Peace must be maintained.</p>
<p>“Spirit” Tom said, is “one of the slipperiest terms in the English language.” With Spirit (whether “ruach” or “pneuma”), we have multiple genders or no gender. We have meanings of energy, breath, wind, and more. Tom encouraged us to read passages with “spirit” using the other words. He suggests it could be appropriate to call ourselves “people of the Wind.”</p>
<p>Tom reminded us that “the Spirit unsettles us because we’re not controlling it. The breath gives life to things we didn’t know should live.” It brings life, but “it also blows us around, and we look for places to hang on….The unity of the Spirit is a turbulent storm within God’s embrace&hellip;.That’s what peace looks like until we all see God face to face.”</p>
<p>Tom also reminded us that “peace is constantly being unsettled by it’s generosity to strangers and enemies.”</p>
<p>The temple of God is not a single body, but the body of Christ, the Christian body. We are a poem, handiwork, or artwork of God. And unlike other art, “what makes the body of Christ most beautiful and perfect is its generosity to the least fitting parts of the body that are being grafted in.”  God crafts “with those pieces that have been thrown away.” (Quilts, it seems, might be an appropriate metaphor!)</p>
<p>Tom says we can test whether we are being a peace church together by our:</p>
<ul>
<li>hospitality</li>
<li>vision of hope</li>
<li>openness</li>
<li>prayer for each other</li>
</ul>
<p>Tom reminds us that we must hold together both radical <strong>hospitality</strong> <em>and</em> radical <strong>transformation</strong>. Yes, the church is like a hospital, but if people don’t get better in a hospital, it should be shut down.</p>
<p>When it came to Q&amp;A, Tom reminded us that Ephesians, Galatians, Matthew, and James are all in the New Testament, and they “all represent communities that were looking at one another with suspicion.” We need to live with that tension and use our creativity to mending “what’s been broken.”</p>
<p>Extending the metaphors further, one person expressed concern about when the temple being built has parts that are unsafe. Tom encouraged us to look for Jesus in the unsafe places, to address problems, and mentioned  Matthew 18 as one of the biblical warnings.</p>
<p>When asked about traditions of exclusion, Tom returned to the translation of Wind, and reminded us that “Wind can create a lot of damage. Some things [traditions] can use some damage in the church.”</p>
<hr>
<p>For our afternoon delegate session, we focused on the second item in our <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JF-_-DRAFT-Document-V3.pdf">Renewed Commitments</a>: <em>Witness to God&rsquo;s Peace</em>.</p>
<p>We were asked to discuss the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identify one part of our shared peace witness we should work together for the next biennium?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As with my <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/02/225359.html">report from day 1 and the peacemaking gathering</a>, our delegate body made it clear that peacemaking goes well beyond resisting war. As our tables responded to the question, there were many incredible responses, but I’ll highlight the following ones that were recurring themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation care, climate change, watershed discipleship, climate justice</li>
<li>LQBTQ inclusion</li>
<li>Conflict skills, difficult conversation skills, hospitality, and listening</li>
<li>Grounding our peace witness in Jesus and the biblical texts</li>
<li>Immigration and border crises</li>
</ul>
<p>May the energy, breath, and wind of God carry us into creative acts of witnessing to God’s peace.</p>

<p>We had two delegate sessions, today, as well as two worship sessions and an afternoon time for a seminar/panel.</p>
<p>Here was our agenda for the delegate sessions: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Note that there are no resolutions scheduled for today. In fact, there are none for the whole week. The focus this year is continued work on <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/journey-forward/">Journey Forward</a> and our <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JF-_-DRAFT-Document-V3.pdf">Renewed Commitments</a>. That said, there is a Resolutions Committee table, because if resolutions are to be introduced, they want to make sure they are clearly stated and ready for discussion &amp; vote.</p>
<p>The moderator expressed desire for us to work in “spiritual and mutual discernment” as much as possible, and to avoid parliamentary procedures except as needed for official business.</p>
<p>One of those pieces of business that we will be voting on are <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf">bylaw updates</a>. The bylaw changes include adding youth delegates as full voting delegates.  This is an extension of the great Step Up program that started last convention at #MennoCon17 and the Future Church Summit, and has continued for #MennoCon19.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tom Yoder Neufeld led the delegates through study of how God gathers us, using the following verses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deutoronomy 30:2-4</li>
<li>Isaiah 40:11</li>
<li>Jeremiah 29:10-14</li>
<li>Zechariah 10:8</li>
<li>Ephesians 1:10</li>
<li>Ephesians 2:11-22</li>
</ul>
<p>God “whistles” for us to gather into oneness with each other and with God.
In looking at Ephesians 1:3-14, Tom reminds us that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’re meant to run out of breath rehearsing the blessings of God.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tom’s overall message focused on Ephesians 2:11-22, and started a process of investigating how we are both unified and diverse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What makes the body of Christ perfect is all the strangers and enemies that have been grafted in.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the request of the delegates, we had time to discuss in table groups before moving into Q&amp;A with Tom. In answering questions about  “good” versus “bad” diversity, he challenged diversity that is a result of “brokenness, hostility, fear, and sin” while also warning against trying to set a “horizon” or limit on how far God is going with “gathering all things.”</p>
<p>To another question about spiritual diversity, Tom again warned us against trivializing the radical provocation of confessing Jesus Christ as Lord by treating that Christian profession of faith simply as “one flower in a floral arrangement of religions” but at the same time recognizing that God is present in ways and places we aren’t yet imagining.</p>
<hr>
<p>In our afternoon session, Executive Director Glen Guyton gave a state of the church report.  He detailed some of our needs, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need more resources: volunteers, money, and tangible goods</li>
<li>We need less structure, less mechanical authority, and more relational authority</li>
<li>We need to assess where God is calling us today</li>
<li>We need to embrace the generations</li>
<li>We need better leaders</li>
<li>We need to be willing to say “no”:
<ul>
<li>to doing too much</li>
<li>to worldly labels and practices that divide us</li>
<li>to things that don’t model who we are as Anabaptist peacemakers</li>
<li>to traditions and practices that discriminate or hide evil</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>We also started a series of table discussions regarding the on <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/journey-forward/">Journey Forward</a> process and our <a href="http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/JF-_-DRAFT-Document-V3.pdf">Renewed Commitments</a>. Todays question focused on the <strong>Follow Jesus</strong> commitment.</p>
<p>Table groups discussed where Jesus would show up in our town today, where Jesus would go, what Jesus would say, and what Jesus would do. We then shared some of the insights with the group.</p>
<p>We saw Jesus being born in or visiting the margins. We saw Jesus in the tent camps, immigrant detention centers, women’s shelters, and more. We wondered about where Jesus would proclaim hope, and what  the “woes” and “blessed” statements might be.</p>
<p>We looked for where Jesus would have righteous fury with us or with systems. Perhaps Jesus would challenge us with why we haven’t been making disciples. Or how our rules, traditions, and barriers keep people from feeling welcome in our churches. Maybe Jesus would storm into hospitals and throw medical billing into the incinerators.</p>
<p>Maybe Jesus would ask us why we haven’t been loving each other?</p>
<hr>
<p>May we continue to look for Jesus in our midst and in our margins.</p>

<p>I arrived early (very early) to Kansas City, with plenty of time to get registered and reacquainted with the KC Convention Center before the begin of our <strong>Journey Forward: Peacemaking</strong> workshop.</p>
<p>The workshop started with singing <em>Longing for Light</em> and <a href="https://youtu.be/iyqOsuQoJRo">My Soul Cries Out/Canticle of Turning</a>. A beautiful way to begin a peacemaking gathering!</p>
<p>We engaged in “speed networking” to meet a few other participants and share what organization(s) we were representing, what peacemaking activities we are involved in, and what we were excited about for the gathering.</p>
<p>Our facilitator (the same who helped facilitate our denominational discernment at #MennoCon17)  worked with us through several  methods for examining and discussing what we are experiencing with peacemaking. These included introspection, paired discussions, small group discussions, and various all-room activities.</p>
<p>Some of the peacemaking topics our communities and organizations have been engaging in: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Some of our local peacemaking partnerships: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Some of our worldwide peacemaking partnerships: <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Several themes emerged multiple times or in multiple groups throughout the day, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>expanding our peacemaking activities beyond the struggle against militarism and overt violence</li>
<li>an increasing acknowledgement and focus on the sources and systemic issues that contribute to violence</li>
<li>an acknowledgment of the intersections and interconnectedness between many of those issues</li>
<li>an increasing understanding of ways we have been complicit in those systems</li>
<li>struggles with strategizing or building effective coalitions when there are so many fronts in the struggle</li>
<li>placing great value in relationship-building and local peacemaking partnerships</li>
</ul>
<p>During Open Space Technology time, I hosted a group to discuss the idea of aligning our church body by watersheds, instead of governmental boundaries (and our current Districts and Conferences).
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Watershed discipleship breaks down barriers between urban and rural people. It also highlights the many ties among ecology, economy, politics, and other factors  affecting those people whose well-being and fates are tied together. While we know there are potential challenges (such as practical implementation issues and avoiding exclusionary “local nationalism”), looking at peacemaking through this lens yielded fruitful conversation and many ideas. We also discussed that church communities can start partnering in their watersheds, regardless of denominational structural changes.</p>
<p>The peacemaking gathering shared many options for initiatives we could take after the gathering, and there was resounding agreement to have further engagement and sharing on these topics.</p>
<p>We closed the gathering with communion and blessing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Later, the whole convention had our first worship. This year, adult and youth worship are combined. There’s nothing like 3000+ Mennonites singing together. “How can I keep from singing?” 🎶 (Worship sessions will be streamed live all week, if you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MCUSA.Convention">want to follow  along</a>.)</p>
<p>I appreciated the “land acknowledgment”, with respect shown to the place we are inhabiting and the First Nations that stewarded it.  I also appreciated that the worship team brought a variety of instruments and music, and that prayers were heard in many languages, including American Sign.</p>
<p>Executive Director Glen Guyton reminded us that we are a diverse group, but that he hopes “we are unified in our desire to bring healing and hope to the world.” May it be so.</p>

			 <p>If you read <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/02/16/digital-minimalism-reference.html">my review of <em>Digital Minimalism</em></a>, you&rsquo;re aware of the Digital Declutter process. If not, <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/02/16/digital-minimalism-reference.html">head over to read it</a> and then come back here.</p>
<p><em>(Note: I did a podcast on my experiment from this book, over at <a href="https://resilient.substack.com/p/digital-declutter">Resilient</a>)</em></p>
<h1 id="why">Why</h1>
<ul>
<li>To better understand what technologies and practices are worthwhile and valuable for me.</li>
<li>To focus more on high-value activities</li>
<li>To spend more time reflecting, thinking, and praying.</li>
<li>To spend more time reading, creating, repairing.</li>
<li>To spend more time in nature.</li>
<li>To reset my habits and routines.</li>
<li>To help fight the attention economy and the harmful effects it has for discourse, complex thought, and mental health.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what">What</h1>
<p>I am avoiding any unnecessary technologies, and using these questions to help me consider whether a technology is truly critical:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this absolutely necessary?</li>
<li>Could this wait?</li>
<li>Does this align with my highest values? (<em>Mutuality, Learning, Resilience</em>)</li>
<li>Can I mitigate the harmful effects?</li>
<li>Is there another way to accomplish this, even if it would be inconvenient?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am blocking off time twice a day to check email (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), and letting it buffer in between.</p>
<p>I have eliminated most applications from my phone and blocked social &amp; news sites in my browsers. The only alerts I get from my phone will be for direct people connections (texting, work chat, phone calls, video calls, etc.) or travel (rides, flights, directions, etc.), and my phone will be in &ldquo;Do Not Disturb&rdquo; except for core work hours (7-6). My DND is set to allow calls from numbers that are in my contacts.</p>
<p>I will do all my (professional and personal) work from the computer and not my phone.</p>
<p>I will not play video games, read ebooks, or play music &amp; podcasts.</p>
<p>I will do my shopping in stores and I will use the library.</p>
<p>I am establishing operating procedures for my chosen special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can listen to audiobooks, but only with my family</li>
<li>On the weekend, I can watch a movie or couple episodes, but only with family or friends</li>
<li>I have direct links to Facebook Group/Event pages that I need to check periodically, and will check those once a week</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="when">When</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m beginning tonight, with the start of our <a href="http://www.indymenno.org/calendar/">Ash Wednesday service</a> and the beginning of Lent.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m ending on Easter Sunday (April 21st on this calendar) and the end of Lent.</p>
<p>I am holding &ldquo;conversation office hours&rdquo; every day between 4:30 and 5:30 Eastern. You can call me any day during those times.</p>

			 <p><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780525536512">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</a> by Cal Newport ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>
<p><em>(Note: I wrote about my own experience with Digital Declutter <a href="https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/03/06/digital-declutter-the.html">here</a>.)</em></p>
<h1 id="premise">Premise</h1>
<p>You’ve probably already heard: billions of dollars are spent on psychology and technology to claim as much of your attention as possible, to sell as much advertisement possible. The addictiveness of sites, apps, and phones is not an accident, but rather a result carefully engineered to be just so.</p>
<p>In addition, “darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts”, so we are pushed towards outrage, anxiety, and despair.</p>
<p>Various attempts have been made to lessen the negative side effects and addictive properties of modern attention-economy technologies, but they’ve largely been unsustainable.</p>
<p>What to do? Newport Recommends <strong>Digital Minimalism</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="manifesto">Manifesto</h1>
<p><em>Digital Minimalism</em> - <em>A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else.</em></p>
<p>Digital Minimalism includes avoiding “low-value activities that can clutter up [our] time and attention and end up hurting more than they help.” It also means asking ourselves “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” The law of diminishing returns also applies, here.</p>
<h2 id="the-principles">The Principles</h2>
<ol>
<li>Clutter is costly</li>
<li>Optimization is important</li>
<li>Intentionality is satisfying</li>
</ol>
<p>Summary quote from this section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="digital-declutter-program">Digital Declutter Program</h1>
<p>Newport recommends an intentional process to reassess your needs and values.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will <em>take a break from optional technologies</em> in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, <em>reintroduce optional technologies</em> into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine <em>what value it serves</em> in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="taking-the-break">Taking the Break:</h2>
<p>Evaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.</p>
<p>Two methods to “take a break” are <strong>bans</strong> and <strong>operating procedures</strong>. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.</p>
<p>In summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. <em>Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="reintroducing-technologies">Reintroducing Technologies</h2>
<p>To be reintroduced, a technology must:</p>
<ol>
<li>Serve something you <em>deeply</em> value</li>
<li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value</li>
<li>Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it</li>
</ol>
<p>For the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”</p>
<h1 id="practices">Practices</h1>
<p>One of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.</p>
<p>Thus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”</p>
<p>During your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.</p>
<h2 id="practice-area-spend-time-alone">Practice Area: Spend Time Alone</h2>
<p>One of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:</p>

<p><em>Solitude Deprivation</em>: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine &amp; regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.</p>
<p>Newport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.</p>
<p>Thus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.</p>
<p>Through these practices, Newport recommends:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Conversation Centric Communication</em>: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship&hellip;.Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information&hellip;. Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On to the practices:</p>
<h3 id="practice-leave-your-phone-at-home">Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home</h3>
<p>It may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)</p>
<h3 id="practice-take-long-walks">Practice: Take Long Walks</h3>
<p>By yourself. Without your phone.</p>
<h3 id="practice-write-letters-to-yourself">Practice: Write Letters to Yourself</h3>
<p>AKA write in notebooks. Take notes, journal, brainstorm, plan.</p>
<h3 id="practice-dont-click-like">Practice: Don’t Click “Like”</h3>
<p>“No reacts plz”, we might say. This goes back to the micro-approvals and anxiety I mentioned above, as they drive the slot-machine behavior of social media sites. If you must react, share a comment. Or your own writing. Or even better, have a conversation with the person. “Adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges.”</p>
<h3 id="practice-consolidate-texting">Practice: Consolidate Texting</h3>
<p>Keep your phone in Do Not Disturb and only check according to an operating procedure. Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts.</p>
<h3 id="practice-hold-conversation-office-hours">Practice: Hold Conversation Office Hours</h3>
<p>Pick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations.</p>
<h2 id="practice-area-reclaim-leisure">Practice Area: Reclaim Leisure</h2>
<p>All this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.</p>
<p>Here are the three principles, then, of leisure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption</li>
<li>Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world</li>
<li>Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions</li>
</ol>
<p>“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”</p>
<h3 id="practice-fix-or-build-something-every-week">Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week</h3>
<p>Per principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.</p>
<h3 id="practice-schedule-your-low-quality-leisure">Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality Leisure</h3>
<p>Per your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.</p>
<h3 id="practice-join-something">Practice: Join Something</h3>
<p>Join a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!</p>
<h3 id="practice-follow-leisure-plans">Practice: Follow Leisure Plans</h3>
<p>This may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.</p>
<p>Newport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="practice-area-join-the-attention-resistance">Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance</h2>
<p>At this point in history, “extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”</p>
<h3 id="practice-delete-social-media-from-your-phone">Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone</h3>
<p>Once you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.</p>
<h3 id="practice-turn-your-devices-into-single-purpose-computers">Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers</h3>
<p>This is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”</p>
<h3 id="practice-use-social-media-like-a-professional">Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional</h3>
<p>People who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.</p>
<h3 id="practice-embrace-slow-media">Practice: Embrace Slow Media</h3>
<p>Slow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780830841141">Slow Church</a> movement.
Embrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.</p>
<p>Avoid junk and reactivity. Avoid “Breaking News”, which is almost always low-quality, error-prone, and often emotionally manipulative.</p>
<p>Seek opposing viewpoints. Follow feeds from good writers. Save/bunch stories to read once a week.</p>
<h3 id="practice-dumb-down-your-smartphone">Practice: Dumb Down Your Smartphone</h3>
<p>Consider a dumbphone, no phone, or something like the <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/">Light Phone</a> or the <a href="https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/">Punkt Phone</a>.</p>

<p>Our book is a consolidated collection of Actual Play fiction for a <a href="https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/">Burning Wheel</a> campaign that ran for more than sixty sessions over the course of two years.</p>
<p>Eloy Cintron was GM. <a href="mailto:ngoodr@gmail.com">Neil Goodrich</a> (Alistair), Jose Lozada (Aedan), and I (Gyles) were players. Along the way, Neil Goodrich wrote actual play reports as stylized fiction, and the rest of the players contributed some content, as well.</p>
<p>Now, Neil has bound that content together as a beautiful book. Totaling 608 pages, it&rsquo;s even larger than <em>Burning Wheel</em> itself. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<p>It even includes stylized starting and ending character descriptions &amp; sheets.</p>
<p>As we start to go back through the fiction, it&rsquo;s amazing to see how much foreshadowing there is about how the situation and the characters will turn out.</p>

<h3 id="epiphany">Epiphany</h3>
<p>The twelve days of Christmas have concluded, and we are now in Epiphany. This is when Christians celebrate the arrival of the Magi who came to witness the newborn Jesus. In some traditions, we also celebrate his baptism, or even Jesus&rsquo;s miracles and ministry.</p>
<p>Epiphany is a “manifestation”. As the verse above alludes to, and as <a href="http://www.indymenno.org/about/">Pastor Shannon</a> says, it&rsquo;s the “Light breaking in.”</p>
<p><strong><em>In these dark times, where are you seeing the light breaking in?</em></strong></p>
<h3 id="a-theme-for-january">A Theme for January</h3>
<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2SDloLG">Common Prayer</a>, the suggested theme for January is “Shared Economics.” The economics of Caesar and Empire are harmful to people and the world, but the Spirit repeatedly calls people to live differently. The prophets and Jesus had a lot to say about how we handle economics, yet it&rsquo;s a topic that many Christians avoid engaging deeply. In January, we are invited to investigate alternatives and to perform holy experiments.</p>
<p>This January, I&rsquo;ll be reading and writing about one of the suggested books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2RB08c7">God&rsquo;s Economy: Redefining the Health and Wealth Gospel</a>.</p>

			 <p>One of my greatest pleasures is mentoring and coaching. Helping people grow, learn, and achieve their goals is a great feeling and incredibly rewarding.</p>
<p>One of my objectives in mentoring is to make sure that underrepresented and marginalized people are getting solid support and seeing growth opportunities. In 2018 I worked with five people (outside my org chart, that is), and four of them are from backgrounds typically underrepresented within STEM (in general) and information security (in particular). Being involved with inclusive employee resource groups is a good thing in general, but also helped to make connections that helped foster this objective.</p>
<p>We had a lot of great conversations this year, asked a lot of good questions, and leaned into challenges. While I can&rsquo;t dig into specifics of these (obviously), here are a few outcomes I&rsquo;m happy to highlight:</p>
<ul>
<li>One mentee turned around a toxic relationship with their manager, had a great quarter, and is excited for next year</li>
<li>Two mentees found better roles more suited to their skills and experience</li>
<li>Another mentee received a well-deserved promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to new mentoring opportunities in 2019!</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve added and culled a lot of podcasts over the last few years. Here are top ones on my list, and why I listen to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Akimbo: I have no interest in marketing, but I do have interest in the way Seth Godin explores big ideas.</li>
<li>Code Switch: If you don&rsquo;t know what code switching is, you definitely need to listen to this. If you do, you will likely enjoy the variety of topics and perspectives and the charming hosts.</li>
<li>Freakonomics Radio: granted, some of this is &ldquo;pop econ&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s entertaining and frequently has good investigative research or covers big ideas.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s Going Down: the guests frequently outshine the host, but this anarchist podcast is a good source of news from the perspective of the marginalized &amp; oppressed and is sure to expand your perspective.</li>
<li>The Knowledge Project with Shane Parrish: an extension of the Farnam Street learning website, this podcast is interviews with &ldquo;big thinkers&rdquo;. The interviews often wander, but there are almost always important takeaways or food for thought.</li>
<li>Note to Self: a philosophical take on technology trends.</li>
<li>Radiolab: entertaining and sometimes enlightening.</li>
<li>The Rebel Beat: this podcast covers music and radical politics together, showcasing new and old music and interviewing artists of varying genres.</li>
<li>Risky Business: information security current events coverage, with excellent analysis. Easy to skip the sponsor interviews, but even those are well done.</li>
<li>Scene on Radio: I started this podcast with their excellent series &ldquo;Seeing White&rdquo;, and they continue to deliver with &ldquo;Men&rdquo;. As you add this one, make sure you have your app setup to listen to a season in order.</li>
<li>Wait Wait&hellip;Don&rsquo;t Tell Me!: a humorous weekly news quiz that you probably already know about.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend <a href="https://overcast.fm">Overcast</a> for listening to podcasts, and am a happy subscriber.</p>

			 <p>This was my response to <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MartinRalya/posts/h5ErkAsdtch?fscid=z13lczfgmr2rfdmrj04cj3oijsvlhxngupg0k.1542774273477510">Martin Ralya’s concerns about the OSR scene</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+AaronGriffin">Aaron</a>’s comments kind of hit it for me: being defined by “old-school” brings this “remember the good old days?” vibe, which attracts not just people who think fondly of the “good old days” of games, but also folks who think fondly of not having their privilege challenged. This makes it (whether intentional or not) a fundamentally political statement, but also the kind of political statement that carries these “don’t be political” demands which seek to defend any remaining unequal power which they feel is being threatened. I think we’re seeing this play out more and more.
To save this community, I think it would need to focus more on the tangibles of the games themselves (what system, design, or theme issues matter to the community?) and less on the nostalgic “member berries”. And it would need a new name that represents those things.</p>

<hr>
<p>&ldquo;The search for a more human understanding of power and consent is not simply stage-dressing for a bigger fight. It is the big fight.” <a href="https://longreads.com/2017/12/05/the-consent-of-the-ungoverned/">Consent of the Ungoverned</a> is a great read about sex and politics. Immensely quotable.</p>

<hr>
<p>There were at least <a href="https://policeviolencereport.org/">1129 killings</a> by police in the USA last year, and most of the known ones started with responding to a suspected <strong>non-violent offense</strong>. Again, it’s not even clear that guns even need to be brought to those situations, as they endanger to the officer, the suspect, and bystanders. Rather, we need prioritization of de-escalation techniques and the ability to follow-up after the event.</p>
<p>Related: mother <a href="http://wtkr.com/2018/01/03/swatting-victims-mother-to-police-please-let-me-see-my-son/">isn’t allowed to see her dead, SWATted child</a>.</p>

These are fundamental structural problems with the process, though fixable. As you know, I’d prefer to <a href="http://todd.grotenhuis.info/tag/aboliship">#AbolishIP</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-political-ads-malware-scams-misleading">ProPublica reports on scams and malware in political ads on Facebook</a>. But really, this isn’t just about Facebook, but any large-scale ad-driven site.

<p>In addition, a reminder that social media sites are becoming “news” for many people, and oppressive governments are able to delete <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/12/30/facebook-says-it-is-deleting-accounts-at-the-direction-of-the-u-s-and-israeli-governments/">opposition viewpoints</a>.</p>

<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/80fd9634-b18f-4dd1-8468-715873c2687c">The Seventh Princess</a>: I’m amazed this fantasy book for children isn’t still in publication.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780393355949">Fight Club</a>: strange writing style, but better than the movie. Really good, assuming you read both the problems and “solutions&quot; as satire.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780765360038">Warbreaker</a>: this is my favorite Cosmere/Sanderson book. (This was a re-read)</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780440180296">Slaughterhouse Five</a>: so it goes, but it doesn’t have to.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780385490818">The Handmaid’s Tale</a>: maybe this time a dystopian work will warn us off?</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780062409157">The Rise and Fall of DODO</a>: almost as good as <em>Anathem</em>.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780765365279">The Way of Kings</a> and <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780765365286">Words of Radiance</a>: The <em>Stormlight Archive</em> take a long time to get going, but end up being worth it. If you’re reading <em>Stormlight Archive</em> and missed the novella, get <em>lifted</em> up by this bit of <em>awesome:</em> <a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781250166548">Edgedancer</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/b6375dbd-597a-43b0-b896-79169d65d64d">The Butcher of Anderson Station</a>: read this novella after the first <em>Expanse</em> book.</li>
<li><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781534461482">Dragonsong</a>: this was my first Pern experience, and it was really good.</li>

<p>This is why I want you to <a href="http://todd.grotenhuis.info/page/read-these-when-i-die">read</a> <em><a href="http://todd.grotenhuis.info/page/read-these-when-i-die">Changing Lenses</a></em> by Zehr:</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.unburntwitch.com/post/139084743809/why-i-just-dropped-the-harassment-charges-the-man">&ldquo;The simple fact of the matter is the criminal justice system is meant to punish, not protect. I don’t care about seeing him punished - I would rather he get better. And they’ve done nothing to protect me - it’s only made things worse and become another weapon in his arsenal, and the arsenal of the people out there way scarier than him.&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>Remember the toy company (VTech) that was hacked? <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/read/hacked-toy-company-vtech-tos-now-says-its-not-liable-for-hacks">They now have Terms of Service that says they aren’t responsible for hacks</a>. People are rightly outraged that this would fly, but this is nothing new for ToS and EULA, unfortunately. It is commonplace for companies to claim no responsibility. (Whether those terms hold up in court or not is another question, and part of the problem.)</p>
<hr>
<p>Read these concerns about the future of <a href="http://stateofthenet.net/2016/02/22-more-experts-have-fled-horrific-leadership-at-consumer-reports/">Consumer Reports</a>. I wonder how much our current content/marketing setup is a driver for this?</p>

<p>French supermarkets are now going to be <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/french-law-bans-supermarkets-throwing-away-and-spoiling-unsold-food-giving-them-to-food-banks-and-a6855371.html">required to donate (and not spoil) their unsold food</a>. I’m not sure the situation in France, but in the USA, this would be an example of the government “saving” us from problems the government created in the first place. Stores are required to remove still-edible food (<a href="http://qz.com/614516/the-us-pours-thousands-of-gallons-of-milk-a-year-down-the-drain-for-no-good-reason/">example</a>), so naturally hungry and/or frugal people try scavenge it. Furthermore, stores are sometimes held liable if scavengers are harmed while acquiring that food. So, stores increasingly decide to protect themselves from problems that were thrust on them.</p>
