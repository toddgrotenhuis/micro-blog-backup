They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

We can end up working as hard (or harder) for those beliefs than we do trying to follow the Lamb.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" title=\"Download The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_378387804\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png\" alt=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 2x, https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br>Specifically, far too many Christians in Christendom have an unhealthy (and frankly, heretical) confusion of social conservatism and Christianity. They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don&rsquo;t necessarily add value.<br><br>To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<br><br></div><ul><li>here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result</li><li>there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own</li><li>there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work</li></ul><div><br></div><div>For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle. I&rsquo;ve been advocating for this two-step approach, but now have a different way to talk about it.<br><br></div><h1>Focus, Flow, and Joy</h1><div>We have a culture of meetings. This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<br><br>Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<br><br>We&rsquo;ve got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<br><br></div><ul><li>&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus</li><li>&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I&rsquo;ve been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We&rsquo;ve got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I&rsquo;m helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn&rsquo;t a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn&rsquo;t have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it&rsquo;s very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to speak up, that their concerns won&rsquo;t be dismissed and they won&rsquo;t be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won&rsquo;t be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn&rsquo;t used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div><div><br></div><div>&mdash;<br><br>I hope taking a look at these 5 ideals was helpful for you.

We've got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I'm helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn't a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn't have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it's very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it's ok to speak up, that their concerns won't be dismissed and they won't be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it's ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won't be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn't be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn't used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div><div><br></div><div>---<br><br>I hope taking a look at these 5 ideals was helpful for you.

(One can imagine decentralized systems that protect rights and rule of law, for example).

(One can imagine decentralized systems that protect rights and rule of law, for example). Nor have the authors deeply examined resource/environmental extraction and what that will mean for the future of all institutions, should our approach to natural resources not shift to an inclusive model.</blockquote><div><br>Have you read this book or one of the others that talk about why nations rise and fall?

We have to want a better world for everyone. We have to look at how improvements can make things better overall.<br><br>We don’t get there simply by being anti-. We don’t get there by treating others as enemies to be defeated. Rather, we can look to others as potential co-conspirators ready to tackle challenges together.<br><br>One way to step out of the enemy-making view is to look at a level level above the individual. What is the mood of the group? What is the spirit of the organization? What is the faith of the locality? What is the tone of the structure?<br><br>You can mix and match these words, too. The Christian Bible talks about the “principalities and the powers”. German philosophers talk about “the zeitgeist”.

				"content_html": "<p><div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>Yes, I&rsquo;m processing these &ldquo;out loud&rdquo; on the Internet. Writing helps me work through it and keeps me honest to myself. I won&rsquo;t share all the details, but will share a few notes along the way.<br><br><em>The Background:<br></em>All the leaders in my broader group (think: my boss&rsquo;s boss&rsquo;s group, about 800 people) are going through a leadership curriculum. As part of this, we had a leadership competency survey that went to our manager, a small number of self-selected peers, and a small number of self-selected stakeholders. There were 27 questions rated 1-5, with 3 questions for each of the 9 competencies that were being measured.<br><br><em>Initial Observations:</em></div><ol><li><strong>Benchmark:</strong> One of the first things I looked at was whether I exceeded the benchmark score. This was not simple vanity: it&rsquo;s at the top of the report. The summary shows how I scored myself overall, how each of the respondent groups rated me overall, and how the broader respondents rated everybody (the benchmark). I&rsquo;m happy to see that I exceeded the benchmark, but without a view of the distribution I can&rsquo;t tell for sure how significant the difference is. I realize I <em>should not spend too much time here</em>, as it&rsquo;s comparative with others and not necessarily fruitful.</li><li><strong>Perception Gaps: </strong>Next, the survey advises to be wary of gaps between the self-rating and those of respondents, or between types of respondents. They suggest that 1 point (in either direction) is cause for concern. I&rsquo;ve made progress here! In other community assessments (e.g. EQ360) in years past, I significantly underrated myself. I&rsquo;m pleased that I still erred towards under-estimation, and that the margin of under-estimation has dropped to 0.28 points (on that 5-point rating scale). My goal is to continue to get that closer to 0, but as long as there is an error, I&rsquo;d rather it be on the side of under-estimation. I had no major gap between respondent group types, which indicates I&rsquo;m not overly-prioritizing some audiences over others. Later in the report we&rsquo;ll look at gaps on specific rating areas.</li><li><strong>Competencies:</strong> Across the 9 competencies, mine were all clustered around the same rating (only 0.27 difference between my best and worst), with scores I&rsquo;m happy with. The only surprising result here was &ldquo;Dare to Be Curious&rdquo; being my worst. Why? Because <em>curiosity</em> is one of my primary approaches, especially in challenging moments or situations. Looking at the three questions that contributed to that competency rating, my lowest result (4.6) was for <em>&ldquo;Asks the &lsquo;right&rsquo; questions to size up or evaluate situations&rdquo;</em>. I know that sometimes I go too quickly to brainstorming and solving instead of asking coaching-style questions. I&rsquo;ll continue to work on this practice. Here is the ranking of my competencies, in order:<ol><li>Model the Way</li><li>Value Every Voice</li><li>Respect Differences</li><li>Connect with Purpose</li><li>Improve and Grow</li><li>Partner for Success</li><li>Embrace Transparency</li><li>Make it Happen Today</li><li>Dare to Be Curious</li></ol></li></ol><div><br><em>Breakdown:<br></em>I like the way they&rsquo;ve looked at the four quadrants based on self-rating and respondent rating.

As with <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/02/07/knowing-my-strengths.html\">StrengthsFinder</a> I should lean into these. I am glad all of these are in the <em>Strengths</em> section:<ol><li>Welcomes the contributions of team members</li><li>Treats people with respect</li><li>Keeps others informed about decisions that affect their job</li><li>Openly discusses my career path goals with me</li><li>Demonstrates strong business/personal ethics</li></ol></li><li><strong>Areas for Improvement: </strong>These are my bottom 5 areas. These are questions where the answers are a little painful and represent my biggest development opportunities. I'm not going to beat myself up about these, because even my worst was a good score (4.56 out of 5), but they are still places where I can and will continue to grow.<ol><li>Fosters an environment where employees want to do their best</li><li>Asks the \"right\" questions to size up or evaluate situations</li><li>Understands how to get things done through formal/informal processes and procedures</li><li>Openly shares mistakes, shortcomings and failures to help others learn and avoid similar issues</li><li>Has the ability to link long-range visions and concepts to daily work</li></ol></li><li><strong>Hidden Strengths</strong>: Earlier, we talked about how being off by a whole point could be a gap in perception. Well, these are the two questions where I scored myself a point less than my respondents (I gave myself a 4 and they gave me a 5). I should update my perspective in these areas:<ol><li>Treats people with respect</li><li>Keeps others informed about decisions that affect their job</li></ol></li><li><strong>Blind Spots: </strong>none! There were no questions where I gave myself a point more than the respondents did. I'm very happy to see that. </li></ol><div><br>This was a good experience to go through. I'll look to lean in more to my strengths, continue to work on my areas for improvement, and update my perceptions of my skills.</div>\n</div><br><hr><i>Originally posted at <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/processing-my-leadership-competency-survey-bd903908\">Hey World</a></i>\n",

More interesting is that there were actually [7 brave senators who did the right thing](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/14/republican-rebels-trump-impeachment-trial). In the modern USA, tribal affiliation & licentious grandstanding are much more important than truth, liberty, or justice.\n\n“This is not who we are”, people said after mobs attacked congress. But unfortunately, it _is_ part of who we are. And the result of this vote is another signal that it is part of who we are _and who we will continue to be_.\n\nThat is why I said “shortsighted”: far too many people are continuing to normalize lying and violence as acceptable means to achieve political goals. This is the road to ruin.[^1]\n\nThis vote (and continued denialist behavior) all-but-guarantees that we will have more political violence. Further, the next populist & would-be-autocrat is unlikely to be as bumbling as 45, and much more capable at helping the powerful & politically-connected at the cost of everyone else.\n\nAll with good will towards humanity should seek to prevent the rise of the next dangerous populist, and to limit the harm that they can do if they gain power.\n\nHere are some of the things Christians are called to do:\n\n- Speak truth and refuse conspiracy, lies, and false witness[^2]\n- Love our neighbors and the people we encounter, especially ones unlike us[^3]\n- When we feel a loss of power & privilege, feel maligned, or have been harmed: love our enemies & persecutors and pray for them[^4]\n- Seek the good of the poor, the prisoner, the ailing, the oppressed[^5], the widow, the orphan, and the foreigner[^6]\n- Dismantle our weapons and create tools that support life[^7]\n\n\n[^1]: _Lying and violence are especially being normalized for groups that already have great power, with peaceful protests from among the marginalized being attacked and labeled as terrorism.

This is the “default” mode of fascism.\n\n—\n\nPersonally, I prefer option 1 (with some additional safeguards/protections) over 3 over 2 over 4. But regardless of your preference for options 1 through 3, I hope it is clear that option 4 is the most inconsistent and dangerous of all of the positions.\n",

And though I listen to less than I used to (due to more meetings and more podcasts &amp; audiobooks) I still really enjoy listening to music when I can. I explore new sounds and visit old favorites. I play music for different moods &amp; contexts. I curate playlists with a unique style of sound. I still think of my music sometimes like I would when I was a DJ.</p>\n\n<p>After Google killed yet again another one of their best products (Google Music) and replaced it with something worse (YouTube Music) I again started working on going back to the tried-and-true-but-takes-more-work method of owning and managing my own music.</p>\n\n<p>I prefer to source my music from <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a>. I like Bandcamp because they seem to treat the artists better than other sites, and they allow you to manage and re-download or stream the music you have bought through Bandcamp. They also have many features for music discovery. On many Fridays throughout 2020, they removed their cut entirely and let the full purchase price go to the artist/label. I think they do this every once in a while even in non-awful years, too.</p>\n\n<p>I also re-signed up for iTunes Match. Apple has somewhat hidden this service, because they want you to use their streaming service. However, it&rsquo;s still there (look under &ldquo;Features&rdquo; at the very bottom of the main iTunes store page) and is a nice option to make your library available on all your devices. It takes all your apple music, plus anything you have in your chosen music folder (e.g. from CD rips or Bandcamp purchases) and either matches it to the iTunes version of the song, or uploads a copy for your devices to use, if they don&rsquo;t think they have it. It costs much less than streaming services, too.</p>\n\n<p>With this move, I also started &ldquo;scrobbling&rdquo; again. This is a method where you ping a scrobbling service with each song you play, and it keeps track of your listening stats. I use <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/\">last.fm</a>, though there are other compatible services available.

I enjoy reading fiction in a variety of formats: paper, audio, and ebook. A good narrator (such as James Marsters for the Dresden books) really makes an audiobook come alive.\n\nI try to get my physical books via [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis) to support independent sellers. If I cannot find directly there, my next search is on [Indiebound](https://www.indiebound.org/?aff=resilient), for the same reason. I have collected my 2020 recommendations (both fiction and nonfiction) on a [Bookshop list](https://bookshop.org/lists/2020-recommendations-459efe07-b6bd-49eb-aef9-dccf011a914a) for easy perusal. That, and all of the individual book links, are affiliate links.\n\nFor audiobooks and ebooks, I recommend checking your local library using [Overdrive/Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) to borrow the digital books. Many digital booksellers have not adopted a good way for us to pass on, resell, or share digital books like we can with physical books (despite it being easier), so I recommend supporting the library system first.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2021/490a4fa732.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"466\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n* ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ [The Raven Tower](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780316388702) by Ann Leckie - This was a re-read.

Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.</p>\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how different efforts turned out (or didn&rsquo;t):</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"resilient\">Resilient</h3>\n\n<p>Resilient (<a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/\">here</a>) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open &amp; Secure) to share helpful &amp; meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: &ldquo;security, society, sustainability, and self.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively&hellip;it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word&hellip;but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.</p>\n\n<p>So, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient\">Resilient book collection</a>. I wrote about <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography\">watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies</a>.  I made my <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a> graph (notes) from <a href=\"https://owasp.org/\">OWASP</a> and <a href=\"https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/\">CSO50</a> conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.</p>\n\n<p>I host <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/publish\">Resilient</a> on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I&rsquo;m concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people&rsquo;s time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider. I offer a comped subscription to people that I know who sign up, and to anyone else who asks.</p>\n\n<p>But I do think about the audience, the reach, and how often and how well I am delivering value to the audience. I&rsquo;ve not posted enough this year, and not done as much analysis as I would have liked. I keep wondering if I should kill the project and move the items into my general blog.</p>\n\n<p>Yet I also know there are folks specifically wanting or asking for the kind of material that <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/publish\">Resilient</a> provides, and it is the common theme of expertise in my life. So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-fires\">Northern Fires</h3>\n\n<p>I started the <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html\">Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project</a> in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, <a href=\"https://www.silentplanetband.com/\">Silent Planet</a>, has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica). I haven&rsquo;t found people that are interested in joining up, yet, so I&rsquo;ve spent less time on this than on other reading.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame I deprioritized this, because there are many lessons from the Spanish Civil War that are incredibly relevant to the world, today. I&rsquo;m going to pick up reading and writing for this project more in 2021, even if others aren&rsquo;t reading the works along with me. Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"40-for-40\">40 for 40</h3>\n\n<p>I turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I&rsquo;d started collecting will probably make it into the next project&hellip;</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"dearkiddos\">DearKiddos</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/\">DearKiddos</a> was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church.</p>\n\n<p>This one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don&rsquo;t get burnt out on the project.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"inktober\">Inktober</h3>\n\n<p>I had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/\">a few entries and catch-up entries</a> which were frankly pretty bad&hellip;but I knew that going in. Though I wasn&rsquo;t consistent and didn&rsquo;t finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll do it in 2021, or not.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"home-office\">Home Office</h3>\n\n<p>My spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office. Since both of us are working from home full time now (and for a while still to come, it looks like), we converted that room to her office and the guest room to my office.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m happy with how my office is turning out, making it serene and suitable for focus. I installed two shelving units (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/11/07/like-many-i.html\">including this one</a>).  I have one more item I&rsquo;m still trying to get from Ikea, and I hope to get a reading chair when it seems safe to go shopping for those, again, but otherwise it&rsquo;s been very good. I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wet-wild\">Wet &amp; Wild</h3>\n\n<p>(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to call this.)</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access). I&rsquo;d like to have a place to camp and eventually build a cabin/cottage to our unique specifications. I want to preserve some of our ecology and plant some trees, maybe even re-wilding a space, depending on it&rsquo;s current state. I also see it as an investment when a lot of investments are problematic, these days.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve found a few things that <em>sorta</em> work with our criteria (including one I need to investigate further), but nothing yet that has made us move on a purchase. I&rsquo;ll keep my eyes open still in 2021, and am open to leads!</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve also been getting prepped to go camping more, which I miss quite a bit. I got my <a href=\"https://www.bioliteenergy.com/\">Biolite</a> stoves tuned back up, am preparing to remediate my dad&rsquo;s old cooler (it has a crack in the internal lid), replaced our old tent, and got a cold weather sleeping bag.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>What projects have you had this year? How did they go?</p>\n",

While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively...it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a \"work in progress\" and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word...but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.\n\nSo, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a [Resilient book collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient). I wrote about [watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies](https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography).  I made my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) graph (notes) from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [CSO50](https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/) conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.\n\nI host [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/publish) on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I'm concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people's time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.\n\nI'm not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider. I offer a comped subscription to people that I know who sign up, and to anyone else who asks.\n\nBut I do think about the audience, the reach, and how often and how well I am delivering value to the audience. I've not posted enough this year, and not done as much analysis as I would have liked. I keep wondering if I should kill the project and move the items into my general blog.\n\nYet I also know there are folks specifically wanting or asking for the kind of material that [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/publish) provides, and it is the common theme of expertise in my life. So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!\n\n### Northern Fires\n\nI started the [Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html) in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, [Silent Planet](https://www.silentplanetband.com/), has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song. \n\nThe idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica). I haven't found people that are interested in joining up, yet, so I've spent less time on this than on other reading. \n\nIt's a shame I deprioritized this, because there are many lessons from the Spanish Civil War that are incredibly relevant to the world, today. I'm going to pick up reading and writing for this project more in 2021, even if others aren't reading the works along with me. Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works. \n\n### 40 for 40\n\nI turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I'd started collecting will probably make it into the next project...\n\n### DearKiddos\n\n[DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/) was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church. \n\nThis one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don't get burnt out on the project.\n\n### Inktober\n\nI had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made [a few entries and catch-up entries](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/) which were frankly pretty bad...but I knew that going in. Though I wasn't consistent and didn't finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I'm not sure if I'll do it in 2021, or not.\n\n### Home Office\n\nMy spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office. Since both of us are working from home full time now (and for a while still to come, it looks like), we converted that room to her office and the guest room to my office.\n\nI'm happy with how my office is turning out, making it serene and suitable for focus. I installed two shelving units ([including this one](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/11/07/like-many-i.html)).  I have one more item I'm still trying to get from Ikea, and I hope to get a reading chair when it seems safe to go shopping for those, again, but otherwise it's been very good. I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.\n\n### Wet & Wild\n\n(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn't sure what to call this.)\n\nI've been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access). I'd like to have a place to camp and eventually build a cabin/cottage to our unique specifications. I want to preserve some of our ecology and plant some trees, maybe even re-wilding a space, depending on it's current state. I also see it as an investment when a lot of investments are problematic, these days. \n\nI've found a few things that _sorta_ work with our criteria (including one I need to investigate further), but nothing yet that has made us move on a purchase. I'll keep my eyes open still in 2021, and am open to leads!\n\nI've also been getting prepped to go camping more, which I miss quite a bit. I got my [Biolite](https://www.bioliteenergy.com/) stoves tuned back up, am preparing to remediate my dad's old cooler (it has a crack in the internal lid), replaced our old tent, and got a cold weather sleeping bag. \n\n---\n\nWhat projects have you had this year? How did they go?\n",

I can just periodically open up Inoreader and check them _on my schedule_ instead of having the schedule dictated to me.\n\nI check my feeds about once a day, see which items are worth my attention, and either read them directly if short, or export them to [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/) if they are longer or worthy of highlights. My highlights go to [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/todd54), where I keep all my reading notes for review.\n\n### Security & Technology\n\n* [I Am the Cavalry](https://www.iamthecavalry.org/feed/) - security for the public good\n* [O'Reilly](http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom) - their \"4-short links\" tech highlights, in particular\n* [Signal vs. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/feed/) - the Basecamp/Hey blog\n* [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/atom.xml) - security essays and links to security news\n* [Have I Been Pwned](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HaveIBeenPwnedLatestBreaches) - latest breaches announcements\n* [Krebs on Security](http://krebsonsecurity.com/) - security reporting\n* [Zack Whittaker: This Week in Security](this.weekinsecurity.com) - weekly security news roundup\n* [Low Tech Magazine](http://feeds.feedburner.com/typepad/krisdedecker/lowtechmagazineenglish) & [No Tech Magazine](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/NoTechMagazine)- simple low & no tech engineering solutions\n* [Simplifier](https://simplifier.neocities.org/index.html) - breaking down technology to its fundamentals\n* [Google Online Security Blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog) and [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)- research and news from the google security teams\n* [CERIAS](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/rss_2.0) - the Purdue security research center\n* [Indy Hackers Job Board](http://indyhackers.org/jobs.atom) - what's moving in the Indy tech community  \n\n### News & Reporting\n\n* [Beautiful News](http://feeds.feedburner.com/beautifulnewsdaily) - though now over, this was year-long project to share good news through well-designed infographics\n* [Pro Publica](http://feeds.propublica.org/propublica/main) - investigative reporting\n* [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/feed/) - investigative reporting\n* [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/feeds/rss.xml) - \"big tech\" reporting\n\n### Essays & Longreads\n\n* [Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/feed)\n* [Longform](https://longform.org/feed.rss)\n* [Longreads](https://longreads.com/feed/)\n* [Aeon](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AeonMagazineEssays)\n\n### People & Opinion\n\n* [James Clear: Atomic Habits](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/92u84qzqzpbnhw34vefw/qvh8h7h87m8x98il/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS8zLTItMS9yZWZlcj9yaF9yZWY9OThkOGU0NTk=)\n* [Ed Batista: Executive Coaching](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBatista)\n* [Maciej Cegłowski: Idle Words](http://www.idlewords.com/index.xml)\n* [Michal Zalewski: lcamtuf](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/)\n* [Will Larson: Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com/feeds/)\n* [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/archive/feed/)\n* [Ben Werdmüller](https://werd.io/?_t=rss)\n* [Shane Parrish: Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/feed/)\n* [Nicholas Carr: Rough Type](http://www.roughtype.com/?feed=rss2)\n* [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/en.atom)\n* [Front Porch Republic](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/feed/)\n* [Jeremy Friesen: Take on Rules](https://takeonrules.com/feed.xml)\n* [Mr. Money Mustache](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MrMoneyMustache)\n\n### Faith & Health\n\n* [Waging Nonviolence](http://feeds.feedburner.com/WagingNonviolence)\n* [Experimental Theology](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)\n* [Everyday Fitness](https://everydayfitness.substack.com/feed/)\n* [Ekklesia Project](http://www.ekklesiaproject.org/feed/)\n* [Geez Magazine](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeezArticles)\n\n### Other\n\n* [Standard ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/rss/new-releases) - a feed of classic books being published by this great free ebook standardization project\n* [Cool Tools](http://feedpress.me/CoolTools) - tool recommendations\n* [Shareable](https://www.shareable.net/blog/feed) - “people-powered solutions for the common good\"\n* [Cabin Porn](http://cabinporn.com/rss) - photography of cabins, interior and exterior (no, there is no nudity, and rarely any people)\n* [Hunter Angler Gardner Cook](https://honest-food.net/feed/) - recipes (and sometimes essays) for wild food\n* [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feed.atom) - new project recommendations feed\n* [The Cramped](http://www.thecramped.com/feed/) - “celebrating the unique pleasures of analog writing\"\n\n### Mine\n* [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/) - an occasional newsletter, post, or podcast related to resilience: for security, society, sustainability, and self (please let me know if you want a comped full subscription)\n* [This Blog](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/subscribe/) - has a little bit of everything, often in short-form or micro posts\n\n---\n\nThis examen helped me clear up my feeds list by removing a lot of inactive or broken feeds, and also removing ones that I don't read very often.

I generally don&rsquo;t like passive entertainment.</p>\n\n<p>With the diffusion of shows and movies across streaming services (and Netflix &amp; Apple TV not playing nice together), I started using <a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/\">JustWatch</a> to track &ldquo;to watch&rdquo; lists. JustWatch let&rsquo;s me have a single watch list, and go to wherever I can stream (or rent or buy) the show or movie.</p>\n\n<p>This year, I continued my quixotic quest to &ldquo;watch all the sketch comedy&rdquo;. Here are some of the new (to me) ones I that I recommend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show\">A Black Lady Sketch Show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81036255\">The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81087498\">Astronomy Club</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We like to watch &ldquo;funny news&rdquo; at our house. My favorites are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>: the in-depth segments cut deep but also discuss opportunities to do something about it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931\">Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj</a>: a little less what-can-you-do-about-it and a little more in-depth. These could be heavy, which is probably why it&rsquo;s now cancelled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>: I would occasionally watch the previous night&rsquo;s intro portion of this show while having my breakfast. I find Colbert (&amp; his writers) to be the funniest of the late night hosts. Also, lately, the moments where you can hear his wife (or their interactions) are charming.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers\">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>:  Like the above, it was an occasional morning watch of the intro portion of the show. He pulled no punches on calling out problems in the USA presidential administration, to the point where I&rsquo;m frankly surprised he&rsquo;s been able to stay on the air.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At our house, we also enjoy some murder mysteries and &ldquo;police procedurals&rdquo;. Here are the couple that stood out for me this year:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/show/endeavour/\">Endeavour</a>: It&rsquo;s Inspector Morse when he was younger, and they do a brilliant job of creating the setting of each episode (which is really a movie): visually, historically, and audibly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80216172\">Criminal</a>: the premise of these series  is that it&rsquo;s a very sparse set of the interview rooms and a couple hallways, yet they are able to do so much with it. ( <em>note: check for 4 different countries and languages; there are multiple versions with different stories</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are other shows that I recommend:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy\">Ted Lasso</a>: this is my <strong>top recommendation</strong> from this year. On top of being very funny, I appreciate how much maturity and humanity people show each other, even in the face of most of the characters going through something incredibly difficult.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p\">The Repair Shop</a>: this is an incredibly charming show about a shop where people bring in their antiques, family heirlooms, and broken items to be reconditioned. It&rsquo;s a brilliant spot of light in a throwaway consumerist culture, and there are wonderful moments of joy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place\">The Good Place</a>: a hilarious show that introduces and mashes up a lot of philosophical concepts and questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/watchmen\">Watchmen</a>: full disclosure, I hadn&rsquo;t seen the movie or read the comics before watching this spinoff TV show, but am familiar with their basic story line and themes. This was an incredible production that explores a number of both contemporary and timeless problems.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo\">Fargo</a>: like Watchmen, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I am riveted to every season of this show. What I like most about this show is the juxtapositions: beauty &amp; horror, fortune &amp; reversal, education &amp; gallows humor, and much more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD\">The Mandalorian</a>: yes, it&rsquo;s full of fan service, but it&rsquo;s <em>really well-done fan service</em> that re-explores many tropes in fresh ways.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK\">The Boys</a>: these comedy-horror comic book characters made it to TV, and it presents a scathing critique of various power structures.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)\">Community</a>: I wrapped up this series this year. It&rsquo;s intelligent and funny, but you really do have to watch from the beginning in order to understand the characters and their dynamic. Troy &amp; Abed will always have a special place in my heart for the way they portrayed nerdiness in a more authentic and <em>laughing-with</em> rather than <em>laughing-at</em> way.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.history.com/shows/alone\">Alone</a>: I generally shy away from &ldquo;Reality Shows&rdquo; due to vapidity, repetition, and manufactured melodrama. I will often check out survival shows, though (hey, Eagle Scout here!).  What I like about this one compared to some others is that you can see how they setup for the long haul, giving us a chance to see how challenges and priorities shift over the duration of their stay. (Of course, it&rsquo;s also relevant to my theme of <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/\">Resilience</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Big Screen: I didn&rsquo;t watch a lot of movies this year (who did?), but here are the two that stuck with me:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out\">Knives Out</a>: as I mentioned earlier, we enjoy murder mysteries in this house. This was a great twist on those tropes. (I feel like it&rsquo;s this generation&rsquo;s <em>Clue</em>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film)\">El Hoyo (The Platform)</a>: this minimalist dystopian horror film offers several critiques of the current age.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>What did you watch this year? Any recommendations?</p>\n",

On top of being very funny, I appreciate how much maturity and humanity people show each other, even in the face of most of the characters going through something incredibly difficult.\n* [The Repair Shop](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p): this is an incredibly charming show about a shop where people bring in their antiques, family heirlooms, and broken items to be reconditioned. It's a brilliant spot of light in a throwaway consumerist culture, and there are wonderful moments of joy.\n* [The Good Place](https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place): a hilarious show that introduces and mashes up a lot of philosophical concepts and questions\n* [Watchmen](https://www.hbo.com/watchmen): full disclosure, I hadn't seen the movie or read the comics before watching this spinoff TV show, but am familiar with their basic story line and themes. This was an incredible production that explores a number of both contemporary and timeless problems.\n* [Fargo](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo): like Watchmen, I haven't seen the movie, but I am riveted to every season of this show. What I like most about this show is the juxtapositions: beauty & horror, fortune & reversal, education & gallows humor, and much more.\n* [The Mandalorian](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD): yes, it's full of fan service, but it's _really well-done fan service_ that re-explores many tropes in fresh ways.\n* [The Boys](https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK): these comedy-horror comic book characters made it to TV, and it presents a scathing critique of various power structures.\n* [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)): I wrapped up this series this year. It's intelligent and funny, but you really do have to watch from the beginning in order to understand the characters and their dynamic. Troy & Abed will always have a special place in my heart for the way they portrayed nerdiness in a more authentic and _laughing-with_ rather than _laughing-at_ way.\n* [Alone](https://www.history.com/shows/alone): I generally shy away from \"Reality Shows\" due to vapidity, repetition, and manufactured melodrama. I will often check out survival shows, though (hey, Eagle Scout here!).  What I like about this one compared to some others is that you can see how they setup for the long haul, giving us a chance to see how challenges and priorities shift over the duration of their stay. (Of course, it's also relevant to my theme of [Resilience](https://resilient.substack.com/).)\n\nThe Big Screen: I didn't watch a lot of movies this year (who did?), but here are the two that stuck with me:\n\n* [Knives Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out): as I mentioned earlier, we enjoy murder mysteries in this house. This was a great twist on those tropes. (I feel like it's this generation's _Clue_)\n* [El Hoyo (The Platform)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film)): this minimalist dystopian horror film offers several critiques of the current age.\n\n---\n\nWhat did you watch this year? Any recommendations?\n",

				"title": "#DearKiddos: A Vaccine for Cruelty",
				"content_html": "\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/\">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>\n\n<p>I was reading this article today from <em>the Economist</em>: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights\">“No Vaccine for Cruelty”</a> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg\">image</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.</p>\n\n<p>The article says &ldquo;no vaccine&rdquo;, but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let&rsquo;s give this a shot.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"how-authoritarians-rise\">How authoritarians rise</h2>\n\n<p>First, by &ldquo;authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They&rsquo;re sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they&rsquo;re almost always men) or tyrants.</p>\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Make everyone afraid</li>\n<li>Blame someone for it</li>\n<li>Claim to be the savior</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that&rsquo;s the vaccine!).</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"make-everyone-afraid\">Make everyone afraid</h2>\n\n<p>There are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that&rsquo;s genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even <strong>caused</strong> by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to <strong>do something</strong>, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n\n<p>First, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by <strong>being</strong> hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. <em>Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?</em></p>\n\n<p>Another way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (<em>sorry, that’s the topic for another post</em>), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the original source of this information?</li>\n<li>Is this mostly facts or opinions?</li>\n<li>Is this showing things in only the worst way?</li>\n<li>Who are they trying to scare?</li>\n<li>Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (<em>Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"blame-someone-for-it\">Blame someone for it</h2>\n\n<p>The next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called &ldquo;scapegoating&rdquo; or setting up a &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>This is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It&rsquo;s a sad way to create fake togetherness. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on <em>hope</em> was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)</p>\n\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He&rsquo;s trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces.</p>\n\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n\n<p>One thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us. We can live in neighborhoods where there are people with different backgrounds. We can go to schools where everybody doesn&rsquo;t look like us. We can make friends with people with different experiences than us. When we travel, we can learn from and be respectful to the people that are local to the area.

				"content_text": "[#DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/):\n\nI was reading this article today from _the Economist_: [“No Vaccine for Cruelty”](https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights) ([image](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg)).\n\nIt's about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.\n\nThe article says \"no vaccine\", but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let's give this a shot.\n\n## How authoritarians rise\n\nFirst, by \"authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They're sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they're almost always men) or tyrants.\n\nThere's a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:\n\n1. Make everyone afraid\n2. Blame someone for it\n3. Claim to be the savior\n\nLet's break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that's the vaccine!).\n\n## Make everyone afraid\n\nThere are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that's genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!\n\nAs you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even **caused** by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to **do something**, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).\n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nFirst, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by **being** hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. _Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?_\n\nAnother way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (_sorry, that’s the topic for another post_), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:\n\n* Who is the original source of this information?\n* Is this mostly facts or opinions?\n* Is this showing things in only the worst way?\n* Who are they trying to scare?\n* Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (_Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?_)\n\nThere will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.\n\n## Blame someone for it\n\nThe next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called \"scapegoating\" or setting up a \"fall guy\". \n\nThis is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It's a sad way to create fake togetherness. It's \"belonging\" through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on _hope_ was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)\n\nNow, it's true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He's trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces. \n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nOne thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us. We can live in neighborhoods where there are people with different backgrounds. We can go to schools where everybody doesn't look like us. We can make friends with people with different experiences than us. When we travel, we can learn from and be respectful to the people that are local to the area. We can be part of groups and activities where we meet people who think or act differently. Here's why: when you know people that are in the accused group, it's hard for someone to convince you that they are the enemy, because you'll be able to see that the lies and stereotypes aren't true.\n\nAlso, along the lines of _hope_ from phase 1, we can build teams, support, and organizations that serve people and solve problems. When we're used to doing work to make the world a better place, we know that problem-solving is rarely an us-vs-them situation, it's usually something where diversity actually helps in finding new solutions!\n\n_What other ideas do you have for protecting us against the hateful blame game?_\n\n## Claim to be the savior\n\nAt this point, the cycle of blame and fear has ramped up, because the blaming has created more division and fueled fear further. Now the strongman makes the claim to be the savior. They tell you \"look, I know what the problems are...I warned you about them\" (back when they made people afraid) and \"I know how to solve it...I told you who is at fault\" (back when they blamed people). See what's happening here?\n\nThey will tell you they are the only one smart enough to see it all, and strong enough to do something about it. They will often use the language of \"law & order\", meaning that they will wield power, control, and even violence over the groups that they setup to take the blame.\n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nIf you've been following along, you're probably noticing that the strongman isn't really following tradition & law, and is actually creating disorder or at least adding to it. You're right, the claim to “law & order” is a lie, but that doesn't really register for the people who are already afraid and bought into the blame game. That means the best way to defend against phase 3 here is to defend against phase 1 and phase 2, as we discussed above.\n\nThat said, if you're a person of faith (or even if you're not!), you should be wary of anyone who claims they're the only solution to your problems. It's healthy to be a bit cautious (\"skeptical\") of power, and one of the things we can do ahead of time is to build our organizations and institutions in ways where power is shared among more people.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAuthoritarians are seizing more power around the world right now, and it will likely happen again in your lifetime. But when you and your community practice some of these defenses, you can help limit the times it will happen, and lessen the damage that comes when it does.\n",

This is where most inventions, breakthroughs, and changes come. It&rsquo;s also where what&rsquo;s special about you will shine.</li>\n<li>In order to learn about what those special things could be for you: <strong>stay curious</strong>. Learn a little bit about a variety of things, explore the world in the ways that you can, experiment &amp; practice in areas where you are excited to try more, and listen (better: ask!) for specifics when people compliment you.</li>\n<li>When things get hard: <strong>welcome the challenge</strong>. Unless it&rsquo;s actively harmful for you or others, challenges are where you will grow the fastest: in understanding, in confidence, and in skill.

				"content_text": "[#DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/):\n\nI had someone ask me today how I advanced in my career so quickly.\n\nI'd like to share those answers with you, but first, some points up front:\n\n* “advancing\" is not the most important standard of your career: it's more important to look at the impacts (both good and bad) that are the results of our work\n* maybe we should say \"vocation\" instead of \"career\" because you might choose to do non-traditional work or do important-but-unpaid services (maybe that's another topic!)\n* I was pretty lucky to grow up in a situation where I didn't have major health or safety troubles, never lacked access to educational resources, and wasn't treated like an outsider: we call this \"privilege\" and it means it was easier for me to get going in my career (and other things were easier as well!)\n\nWith that said, here's an edit of what I shared with that person, today:\n\n* There are many specialists who are very good at one thing, and many generalists who are ok at a lot of things, but one of the best ways to make a big and unique impact is to **combine two _different_ types of things that you are good at**. This is where most inventions, breakthroughs, and changes come. It's also where what's special about you will shine.\n* In order to learn about what those special things could be for you: **stay curious**. Learn a little bit about a variety of things, explore the world in the ways that you can, experiment & practice in areas where you are excited to try more, and listen (better: ask!) for specifics when people compliment you.\n* When things get hard: **welcome the challenge**. Unless it's actively harmful for you or others, challenges are where you will grow the fastest: in understanding, in confidence, and in skill. It's how to build up experience more quickly. But you only grow if you dive into the challenge instead of avoiding it!\n\nHopefully one or more of these tips will be helpful for you.\n",

(By “voice”, I mean they have some say in what happens.) This does not always work out perfectly, but it is much better than not having a voice at all!</p>\n\n<p>One of the common ways that people have a voice in democracy is by voting. There are many ways of voting, and some ways are better than others (maybe we can talk about that some other time!). But one thing that is true across different types of voting is that people are allowed to vote, as an important way to use that voice.</p>\n\n<p>Because of that, we should <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/09/03/covid-19-and-an-atmosphere-of-distrust-pose-grave-risks-to-americas-election\">be aware when people try to limit people’s ability to vote</a>. If somebody is trying to make it so that others don’t have a voice, it is a warning sign. We usually call it “voter suppression”, meaning that votes are stopped or “suppressed”.  People might try to stop others from voting for a variety of reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>they think their own voice is more important than others</li>\n<li>they think that democracy is not the right way to run things for the group</li>\n<li>they want to hold unfair power over others</li>\n<li>they are afraid things will change from what they are used to</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Often, it could be more than one of those reasons!</p>\n\n<p>There are many ways that people try to stop others from voting, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>making it cost money to vote: either directly (like a tax/fee) or indirectly (like needing to spend money or miss work to travel to vote or to send in your vote)</li>\n<li>making it confusing to vote: with complex voting systems, disinformation (meaning: spreading lies about voting or about the details &amp; options for the vote), or by changing the rules</li>\n<li>limiting voting options: by places available, the times allowed to vote, and what even is allowed to show up on the voting list</li>\n<li>limiting who can vote: by age, race, gender, or some other status in the voting group</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Sometimes, people even make it so that the voting system itself helps some groups or areas more than others (examples of this are “electoral colleges”, “gerrymandering”, and “two-party systems”, in case you want to look those up).</p>\n\n<p>So, if a vote is coming up, and you see a group trying to limit who can vote, consider why they are doing that.

The book is part of Penguin&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/TPC/pocket-change-collective/\">Pocket Change Collective</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-idea\">The Idea</h2>\n\n<p>Climate change is a challenge that effects not just the environment we live in, but is tied to our most important political and economic issues. It&rsquo;s going to be a lot cheaper to solve it now than try to address the damage, dangers, and losses as they continue to come. Taking action now means we can be more proactive, sustainable, and just in our approach. To do so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We&rsquo;ve got to get creative</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;ve got to go beyond our artificial borders</li>\n<li>We&rsquo;ve got to listen to those who are impacted the worst</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We can do it.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"the-quotes\">The Quotes</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&rdquo;&hellip;the climate crisis is more like a fucked-up web that connects and impacts every single thing we care about. It amplifies all the existing problems we experience today, from racial injustice to economic inequality to health issues to food access to war.

				"content_text": "_[Imaginary Borders](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780593094136?aff=resilient)_ by Xiuhtezcatl Martinez\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️, Recommended\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/166e846ff4.jpg\" width=\"317\" height=\"446\" alt=\"\" />\n\n## Some Background\n\nThe author is a talented [hip-hop artist](https://xiuhtezcatl.com) and serves as Youth Director for [Earth Guardians](https://www.earthguardians.org). The book is part of Penguin's [Pocket Change Collective](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/TPC/pocket-change-collective/). \n\n## The Idea\n\nClimate change is a challenge that effects not just the environment we live in, but is tied to our most important political and economic issues. It's going to be a lot cheaper to solve it now than try to address the damage, dangers, and losses as they continue to come. Taking action now means we can be more proactive, sustainable, and just in our approach. To do so:\n\n* We've got to get creative\n* We've got to go beyond our artificial borders\n* We've got to listen to those who are impacted the worst\n\nWe can do it.\n\n## The Quotes\n \n> \"...the climate crisis is more like a fucked-up web that connects and impacts every single thing we care about. It amplifies all the existing problems we experience today, from racial injustice to economic inequality to health issues to food access to war. It affects our economies, our politics, and our cultures.\"\n\n> \"Wallace-Wells then went on to say that climate damages would create about $600 trillion in expenses by the end of the century. To put that in perspective, that’s twice as much as all the wealth in the world today. I caught myself laughing, thinking about all the people who say acting on climate is too expensive.\"\n\n> \"...the most critical piece of this conversation: the deep need to create a cultural shift that includes people in every facet of society.\"\n\n> \"Systematic injustices of economic disparity and discriminatory city planning push communities of color to the greatest danger zones for flooding and superstorms.\"\n\n> \"The irony is that the nations discriminating against immigrants are the ones responsible for releasing the most carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which is creating the conditions that are causing more people to seek refuge.\"\n\n> \"It’s only fair that wealthier countries pay for cleaning up the climate mess that they’re mostly responsible for...\"\n\n> \"...more than eight million people die from air pollution every year...\"\n\n> \"White people on average experience 17 percent less air pollution than they produce, while black and brown communities receive 61 percent more air pollution than their consumption habits create.\"\n\n> \"All these **imaginary borders** exist in order to disempower us, and they keep our movements fragmented and divided. And it’s going to take us dropping these artificial barriers of partisan politics to really get down to solutions.\"\n\n> \"...one of the most damaging colonial legacies from a climate perspective is the illusion that we are separate from our environment.\"\n\n> \"Everything changes when the places we love are threatened.\"\n\n> \"...our society is heavily based on an economic model that is built on the exploitation of human and natural resources.\"\n\n> \"Climate solutions need to take economic justice into account because if we perpetuate the same old top-down systems, we won’t be able to solve our crisis holistically.\"\n\n> \"Currently, the US government is spending $649 billion annually to subsidize fossil fuels....Redirecting the money the government is pouring into propping up the fossil fuel industry would more than finance the entire Just Transition of our energy economy.\"\n\n> \"The story we’ve been telling about climate change has failed to truly evoke and inspire connection because it has lacked imagination and creativity.\"\n\n> \"I believe the climate crisis can inspire the best in humanity.

I believe in dismantling [CAFO farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_Animal_Feeding_Operation), the [\"nutritional industrial complex\"](https://michaelpollan.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/in_defense_excerpt.pdf), food subsidies, and monocultures.\n\nI understand that these goals are not accomplished overnight or maybe even in my lifetime. I believe we should pursue them anyway, building fair and just alternatives along the way.\n\n## 🌹\n\nI believe in equity and fairness. I believe in listening to and amplifying the voices of the oppressed and marginalized. \n\nI believe you can tell a lot about a person based on whether they defend the powerful or the powerless. I believe in sharing, cooperatives, mutual aid societies, unions, partnerships, and common purses. I believe in resisting advertising, addiction, and the attention economy. I believe in supporting underdogs and resisting monopolies. I believe that those who extract from people and the earth should pay their share of costs (e.g. for protection, legal, and infrastructure), and not be subsidized by the ones they are extracting from. I believe that abandoned properties may justly be reclaimed and restored by those willing to care for them. I believe in helping our neighbors. I believe in sharing over hoarding. I believe in working together.\n\nI understand that equity is difficult when injustices still exist. I believe people with privilege should share that privilege, anyway, working towards a better future for all.\n",

[2]</p>\n\n<p>Such is the fate of the nation state [3]  despite the myths they propagate. [4] The narrative never fits the crime. Democracy’s died this death a thousand times.

[6]\nWe stand alone in the dust of what could be, fighting to find our humanity.</p>\n\n<p>Bury me with my name in an unmarked grave - another casualty to the vanity of history. [7] The war marches on after the killing ends. [8] Take our lives: Colonize our minds. [9]</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been digging through timelines, historical bylines; I find the fatal flaw in our design lies between thoughts we had and words we knew [10] - between what we’re told and what is true. [11] Who fuels the fascist? [12] A classist - inculcating the masses in passes&hellip; under the contrived countenance of contrition.

The bell will toll [16] and in the end lay only echoes of what could have been. [17]</p>\n\n<p>We stand alone in the dust of what could be, fighting to find our humanity.

This time, I decided to start with <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/203657/Risus-Companion?affiliate_id=21283\">Risus</a>, a very simple system that uses ratings called “clichés”.</p>\n\n<p>Since we play Team Fortress 2 as a way to hangout and talk, we decided to set the game in the TF2 setting and use the TF2 classes (scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy) as our clichés. Having this pick list gave them enough, but not too much, variety to choose from.</p>\n\n<p>I used a semi-standard Risus setup of starting ratings at 4, 3, 2, 1 (for the total of 10). I also told them their agency would give them 1 basic weapon and 1 tool, or 4 tools. They both chose the first option. (Maybe I should have made it 5 tools, as it didn’t seem like a hard choice but for them.) They also picked code names and their “real names”.  I encouraged them not to have the same things as each other in 3 and 4. Their characters started off like this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Codename</strong>: Z7\n<strong>Real name</strong>: Megan\n<strong>4</strong>: Engineer\n<strong>3</strong>: Scout\n<strong>2</strong>: Spy\n<strong>1</strong>: Heavy\n<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: shotgun\n<strong>Tool</strong>: Wrench</p>\n\n<p><strong>Codename</strong>: H6\n<strong>Real name</strong>: Jace\n<strong>4</strong>: Heavy\n<strong>3</strong>: Pyro\n<strong>2</strong>: Scout\n<strong>1</strong>: Sniper\n<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: rifle\n<strong>Tool</strong>: binoculars</p>\n\n<p>We didn’t have enough d6s, so I used d10s. I also used the Risus variant where you look at the <em>best</em> die in the roll, instead of the total. To play, when they wanted to do something interesting with an uncertain outcome, I asked them to describe it, told them which of their cliches was appropriate, and gave them a difficulty between 6 and 10.  I also brought in the Risus conflict rules, again using versus instead of totals.</p>\n\n<p>I also brought in “bennies” to the system, in order to give us a little more flexibility. I awarded them 1 at the start of their mission, and told them they’d get another any time I thought they did something really interesting or clever. They could give me a bennie when they failed a roll and wanted to re-roll it. However, when I got a bennie from then, I could put it back in the pool to add a twist to the story. (In retrospect, I could have instead set it up where I “pay” it to whoever was affected by the twist, but this gets complicated when it could affect both of them.)</p>\n\n<p>I did one more piece of prep. I marked up a pile of note cards with “standard exits” at each cardinal direction and various paths connecting them.</p>\n\n<p>To play, I asked them to pick a card (from a face down spread). I added some more rough drawings to this card to turn it into their headquarters for their agency (which they decided was called the “Adventurers Agency”).</p>\n\n<p>They were given their mission: to shut down the Mann Co factory that was producing robots that were being created and sent out to take over the city. They were also warned that some of the robots had been designed to look like humans! They were able to requisition a little more equipment, based on the mission. They ended up with a stun stick (with 3 charges), 1 stick of dynamite, and x-ray googles that could look through a nearby surface and maybe detect false robots.</p>\n\n<p>The rest of it played out through the story. When they traveled “off a card” on our map, I had them pull a random card to place in that direction they went, and I added a few more light details to that section of the map that was being built out. I had decided at the beginning which one would represent the final factory, but of course I provided a lot of challenges to them along the way.</p>\n\n<p>The finale was when they ended up using the stick of dynamite to disable the power supply for the plant.

He started by expressing thanks for the corrective and affirming feedback he received from yesterday’s session, reminding us that receiving such is a good sign of mutual discernment.</p>\n\n<p>His theme was “Unity of the Spirit - body and temple” based on Ephesians 4:3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the <strong>chain</strong> of peace</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tom used the literal translation of “chain” for what might normally listed as “bond” because it’s an appropriate reminder that chains are for things that come apart. Peace must be maintained.</p>\n\n<p>“Spirit” Tom said, is “one of the slipperiest terms in the English language.” With Spirit (whether “ruach” or “pneuma”), we have multiple genders or no gender.

He started by expressing thanks for the corrective and affirming feedback he received from yesterday’s session, reminding us that receiving such is a good sign of mutual discernment.\n\nHis theme was “Unity of the Spirit - body and temple” based on Ephesians 4:3 \n\n> making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the **chain** of peace\n\nTom used the literal translation of “chain” for what might normally listed as “bond” because it’s an appropriate reminder that chains are for things that come apart. Peace must be maintained. \n\n“Spirit” Tom said, is “one of the slipperiest terms in the English language.” With Spirit (whether “ruach” or “pneuma”), we have multiple genders or no gender. We have meanings of energy, breath, wind, and more. Tom encouraged us to read passages with “spirit” using the other words. He suggests it could be appropriate to call ourselves “people of the Wind.”\n\nTom reminded us that “the Spirit unsettles us because we’re not controlling it.

And unlike other art, “what makes the body of Christ most beautiful and perfect is its generosity to the least fitting parts of the body that are being grafted in.”  God crafts “with those pieces that have been thrown away.” (Quilts, it seems, might be an appropriate metaphor!)\n\nTom says we can test whether we are being a peace church together by our:\n\n* hospitality\n* vision of hope\n* openness\n* prayer for each other\n\nTom reminds us that we must hold together both radical **hospitality** *and* radical **transformation**. Yes, the church is like a hospital, but if people don’t get better in a hospital, it should be shut down.\n\nWhen it came to Q&A, Tom reminded us that Ephesians, Galatians, Matthew, and James are all in the New Testament, and they “all represent communities that were looking at one another with suspicion.” We need to live with that tension and use our creativity to mending “what’s been broken.”\n\nExtending the metaphors further, one person expressed concern about when the temple being built has parts that are unsafe.

I also appreciated that the worship team brought a variety of instruments and music, and that prayers were heard in many languages, including American Sign.\n\nExecutive Director Glen Guyton reminded us that we are a diverse group, but that he hopes “we are unified in our desire to bring healing and hope to the world.” May it be so.\n\n",

During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, <em>reintroduce optional technologies</em> into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine <em>what value it serves</em> in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"taking-the-break\">Taking the Break:</h2>\n\n<p>Evaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[C]onsider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Newport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.</p>\n\n<p>Two methods to “take a break” are <strong>bans</strong> and <strong>operating procedures</strong>. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.</p>\n\n<p>In summary:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. <em>Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"reintroducing-technologies\">Reintroducing Technologies</h2>\n\n<p>To be reintroduced, a technology must:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Serve something you <em>deeply</em> value</li>\n<li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value</li>\n<li>Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>For the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"practices\">Practices</h1>\n\n<p>One of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”</p>\n\n<p>During your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-spend-time-alone\">Practice Area: Spend Time Alone</h2>\n\n<p>One of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Solitude Deprivation</em>: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Time with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine &amp; regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Newport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.</p>\n\n<p>Through these practices, Newport recommends:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Conversation Centric Communication</em>: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship&hellip;.Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information&hellip;. Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On to the practices:</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-leave-your-phone-at-home\">Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home</h3>\n\n<p>It may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-take-long-walks\">Practice: Take Long Walks</h3>\n\n<p>By yourself. Without your phone.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-write-letters-to-yourself\">Practice: Write Letters to Yourself</h3>\n\n<p>AKA write in notebooks. Take notes, journal, brainstorm, plan.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-don-t-click-like\">Practice: Don’t Click “Like”</h3>\n\n<p>“No reacts plz”, we might say. This goes back to the micro-approvals and anxiety I mentioned above, as they drive the slot-machine behavior of social media sites. If you must react, share a comment. Or your own writing. Or even better, have a conversation with the person. “Adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges.”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-consolidate-texting\">Practice: Consolidate Texting</h3>\n\n<p>Keep your phone in Do Not Disturb and only check according to an operating procedure. Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-hold-conversation-office-hours\">Practice: Hold Conversation Office Hours</h3>\n\n<p>Pick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-reclaim-leisure\">Practice Area: Reclaim Leisure</h2>\n\n<p>All this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.</p>\n\n<p>Here are the three principles, then, of leisure:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption</li>\n<li>Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world</li>\n<li>Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-fix-or-build-something-every-week\">Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week</h3>\n\n<p>Per principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-schedule-your-low-quality-leisure\">Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality Leisure</h3>\n\n<p>Per your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-join-something\">Practice: Join Something</h3>\n\n<p>Join a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-follow-leisure-plans\">Practice: Follow Leisure Plans</h3>\n\n<p>This may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.</p>\n\n<p>Newport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.</p>\n\n<p>For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-join-the-attention-resistance\">Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance</h2>\n\n<p>At this point in history, “[e]xtracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-delete-social-media-from-your-phone\">Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone</h3>\n\n<p>Once you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-turn-your-devices-into-single-purpose-computers\">Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers</h3>\n\n<p>This is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-use-social-media-like-a-professional\">Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional</h3>\n\n<p>People who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"practice-embrace-slow-media\">Practice: Embrace Slow Media</h3>\n\n<p>Slow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Xg6DkK\">Slow Church</a> movement.\nEmbrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Avoid junk and reactivity.

The addictiveness of sites, apps, and phones is not an accident, but rather a result carefully engineered to be just so.\n\nIn addition, “darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts”, so we are pushed towards outrage, anxiety, and despair.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to lessen the negative side effects and addictive properties of modern attention-economy technologies, but they’ve largely been unsustainable. \n\nWhat to do? Newport Recommends **Digital Minimalism**.\n\n# Manifesto\n_Digital Minimalism_ - _A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else._\n\nDigital Minimalism includes avoiding “low-value activities that can clutter up [our] time and attention and end up hurting more than they help.” It also means asking ourselves “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” The law of diminishing returns also applies, here.\n\n## The Principles\n1. Clutter is costly\n2. Optimization is important\n3. Intentionality is satisfying\n\nSummary quote from this section:\n\n> The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.\n\n# Digital Declutter Program\nNewport recommends an intentional process to reassess your needs and values.\n\n> Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will _take a break from optional technologies_ in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, _reintroduce optional technologies_ into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine _what value it serves_ in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value. \n\n## Taking the Break:\nEvaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:\n\n> [C]onsider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.\n\nNewport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.\n\nTwo methods to “take a break” are **bans** and **operating procedures**. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.\n\nIn summary:\n\n> In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. _Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day._\n\n## Reintroducing Technologies\nTo be reintroduced, a technology must:\n\n1. Serve something you _deeply_ value\n2. Be the _best_ way to use technology to serve this value\n3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it\n\nFor the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”\n\n# Practices\nOne of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.\n\nThus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”\n\nDuring your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.\n\n## Practice Area: Spend Time Alone\nOne of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:\n\n> _Solitude Deprivation_: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds\n\nTime with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness.

Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions\n\n“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”\n\n### Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week\nPer principle #2, this should be analog.
