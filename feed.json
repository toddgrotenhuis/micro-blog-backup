Thousands died for their conviction that the church is called to more pressing business than to be socially significant, and thousands still die. We’re all state churches now who don’t appreciate anybody walking around loose who is under the impression that there is a king other than Caesar.

Shuffle &rsquo;em up.</p>\n<p>Each player grabs a pile of cards from the deck and makes 4 stacks in front of them, as well as a hand of cards. Each stack has one face-down card on the bottom and one face-up card on the top. The other 11 cards go in their hand. Anyone who grabbed exactly 19 cards, gets -10 points (this is good!) for this round. Any player that didn&rsquo;t pull exactly 19 cards makes up the difference using the deck.</p>\n<p>Play starts with whoever pulled closest to 19 cards, and goes clockwise. The first player is suggested to be whoever had closest to 19 cards.</p>\n<h1 id=\"eligible-plays\">Eligible Plays</h1>\n<p>Cards are played into a central pile. A player may play as many cards of a rank as they like, using a combination of their face-up cards and cards in their hand. They may alternatively play an uncovered <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> face down card, and, after seeing what it is, add as many matching face-up or hand cards as they like.</p>\n<h1 id=\"results-of-a-play\">Results of a Play</h1>\n<p>Any time the count of cards of the current rank on the pile becomes 4 or more (e.g. five Jacks), or a Ten is played, the current player discards the entire pile and takes an additional turn.</p>\n<p>If they played at the current rank or lower (and there are still less than 4 of that rank on top), play moves to the next player.</p>\n<p>However, if they played a card <em>higher</em> than the current rank (other than a Ten), the player must take the whole pile into their hand and play another turn.</p>\n<h1 id=\"ending-the-round-and-scoring\">Ending the Round and Scoring</h1>\n<p>Once a player gets rid of all their cards (stacks and hand), play stops for the round. That player gets 0 points for the round, and everyone else is penalized for all of their remaining cards.

				"content_text": "Learned another game this weekend: **Tens**.\n\n# Setup\n\nYou need enough decks (without Jokers) for all players to have 19 cards. Shuffle 'em up.\n\nEach player grabs a pile of cards from the deck and makes 4 stacks in front of them, as well as a hand of cards. Each stack has one face-down card on the bottom and one face-up card on the top. The other 11 cards go in their hand. Anyone who grabbed exactly 19 cards, gets -10 points (this is good!) for this round. Any player that didn't pull exactly 19 cards makes up the difference using the deck.\n\nPlay starts with whoever pulled closest to 19 cards, and goes clockwise. The first player is suggested to be whoever had closest to 19 cards. \n\n# Eligible Plays\n\nCards are played into a central pile. A player may play as many cards of a rank as they like, using a combination of their face-up cards and cards in their hand. They may alternatively play an uncovered [^1] face down card, and, after seeing what it is, add as many matching face-up or hand cards as they like.\n\n# Results of a Play\n\nAny time the count of cards of the current rank on the pile becomes 4 or more (e.g. five Jacks), or a Ten is played, the current player discards the entire pile and takes an additional turn.\n\nIf they played at the current rank or lower (and there are still less than 4 of that rank on top), play moves to the next player.\n\nHowever, if they played a card _higher_ than the current rank (other than a Ten), the player must take the whole pile into their hand and play another turn.\n\n# Ending the Round and Scoring\n\nOnce a player gets rid of all their cards (stacks and hand), play stops for the round. That player gets 0 points for the round, and everyone else is penalized for all of their remaining cards. Cards are scored by their rank value, with Aces being 1, Jack 11, Queen 12, King 13, and Tens 20. (_Don't forget the -10 for any player that pulled exactly 19 cards when setting up the round._)\n\n# Winning\n\nPlay more rounds, but one suggestion is to play until someone has hit 100 (ten tens).\n\nWhoever has the fewest points at the end wins!\n\n---\n\n_Have you played this (or something like it)? How did your version differ?_\n\n[^1]: because the face-up card on it has already been played\n",

There will be a king over us! 20 We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us[e] and fight our battles.”\r&10;\r&10;21 So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the Lord.[f] 22 The Lord said to Samuel, “Do as they say[g] and install a king over them.” Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you go back to his own city.”\">\n",

Community of goods meant something different for Hutterites in Moravia, where it eventually came to involve a congregation living together as a household. The practice of community of goods was short-lived among Swiss Anabaptists. When they came under increasing suspicion and pressure from civil authorities, they made clarifications that they had not advocated confiscating property from wealthy people but only wished to implement apostolic practice in the church. Community of goods became a rule against exploitation and about sharing in the congregation.&quot; (J Denny Weaver, Becoming Anabaptist)\">\n",

				"content_text": "Read: _[Dopamine Nation](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/)_ by Anna Lemke\n\n**Recommended**\n\nThere was not much here that was completely new to me, but the stories were well-told, and it was a useful collection of reminders.\n\nFor example, I am reminded once again by the fact that having some self-directed misery in our lives helps us feel much better the rest of the time. Cold baths, ascetic practices, hard exercise, primitive camping, etc. can all help with our balance, perspective, and our physiological state of pain and pleasure.\n\nAnd also again: leaning into survivable, copeable challenges is often the best way through, and leads to the most growth.\n\n# My Reading Highlights and Notes\n\nFrom the Summary:\n\n1. The relentless pursuit of pleasure and avoidance of pain leads to pain\n2. Recovery begins with abstinence\n3. Abstinence resets the brain’s reward pathway, and with it our capacity to take joy in simpler pleasures\n4. Self-binding creates literal and metacognitive space between desire and consumption, a modern necessity in dopamine-overloaded world\n5. Medications can restore homeostasis, but consider what we lose by medicating away our pain\n6. Pressing on the pain side resets our balance to the side of pleasure\n7. Beware of getting addicted to pain\n8. Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhances intimacy, and fosters a “plenty” mindset\n9. Prosocial shame affirms that we belong to the human tribe\n10. Instead of running away from the world, we can find escape by immersing ourselves in it\n",

Do fewer things. 2. Work at a natural pace. 3. Obsess over quality.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>this philosophy rejects busyness, seeing overload as an obstacle to producing results that matter, not a badge of pride. It also posits that professional efforts should unfold at a more varied and humane pace, with hard periods counterbalanced by relaxation at many different timescales, and that a focus on impressive quality, not performative activity, should underpin everything.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-1-foundations\">Part 1 FOUNDATIONS</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-the-rise-and-fall-of-pseudo-productivity\">1 THE RISE AND FALL OF PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY</h3>\n<p>It’s hard to overemphasize how unusual it is that an economic sector as large as knowledge work lacks useful standard definitions of productivity.</p>\n<p>In the absence of more sophisticated measures of effectiveness, we also gravitate away from deeper efforts toward shallower, more concrete tasks that can be more easily checked off a to-do list. Long work sessions that don’t immediately produce obvious contrails of effort become a source of anxiety—it’s safer to chime in on email threads and “jump on” calls than to put your head down and create a bold new strategy.</p>\n<p><strong>PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY</strong> The use of visible activity as the primary means of approximating actual productive effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Many people would rather pretend to be busy in an air-conditioned office than stamp sheet metal all day on a hot factory floor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-a-slower-alternative\">2 A SLOWER ALTERNATIVE</h3>\n<p>There’s a personal satisfaction in grimly pointing out the flaws in a system, but sustainable change, Petrini came to believe, requires providing people with an enjoyable and life-affirming alternative.</p>\n<p>There’s a temptation in activism to propose radically new ideas, as this preserves the utopian possibility of a pristine solution. Petrini recognized, however, that when it came to presenting an appealing alternative to fast food, he would be wise to draw from traditional food cultures that had developed through trial-and-error experimentation over many generations.</p>\n<p>Once isolated, Petrini’s two big ideas for developing reform movements—focus on alternatives to what’s wrong and draw these solutions from time-tested traditions—are obviously not restricted to food in any fundamental sense. They can apply to any setting in which a haphazard modernism is conflicting with the human experience. This claim is validated by the many new slow movements that arose in the wake of Slow Food’s original success, targeting other aspects of our culture that were suffering from an unthinking haste.</p>\n<p>This sudden interest in workplace experimentation is both welcome and needed, as much about how we work in the knowledge sector today is ossified into tradition and conventions, some of which are arbitrary and some of which are borrowed from different, older types of work.</p>\n<p>Moves to maintain telecommuting or reduce the workweek help blunt some of the worst side effects of pseudo-productivity but do little to address the root problem itself.</p>\n<p>a more sustainable response to the burnout crisis facing knowledge work would be to offer an appealing alternative. This would require moving beyond attempts to simply constrain pseudo-productivity to instead propose a brand-new vision of what productivity can mean.</p>\n<p><strong>KNOWLEDGE WORK</strong> (GENERAL DEFINITION) The economic activity in which knowledge is transformed into an artifact with market value through the application of cognitive effort.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>it’s worth noting that the general mindset and mood conveyed in these tales are also of stand-alone value. Following Petrini’s lead, I’m convinced that one of the best ways to truly introduce you to the “lost art of accomplishment without burnout” is to immerse you in the world of those who successfully built their lives around this goal.</p>\n<p>I want to reassure you that slow productivity doesn’t ask that you extinguish ambition. Humans derive great satisfaction from being good at what they do and producing useful things. This philosophy can be understood as providing a more sustainable path toward these achievements.</p>\n<p>Though this book is about knowledge work productivity in general, it targets in particular anyone who has a reasonable degree of autonomy in their job. This obviously includes freelancers, solopreneurs, and those who run small businesses. Pseudo-productivity’s presence in these particular settings is not due to a boss’s demands but is instead largely self-imposed, which opens up vast potential for individual experimentation. My imagined audience, however, also includes those who might work for larger employers but still enjoy significant freedom in how they go about their work.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that slow productivity cannot one day reform these corners of knowledge work as well (see my discussion in the conclusion of this book about my broader vision for the future of this movement), but every revolution needs a starting point, and for something as momentous as rethinking the very notion of productivity itself, it makes sense to focus at first on those for whom self-experimentation is possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-2-principles\">Part 2 PRINCIPLES</h2>\n<h3 id=\"3-do-fewer-things\">3 DO FEWER THINGS</h3>\n<p>PRINCIPLE #1: DO FEWER THINGS Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most.</p>\n<p>I found myself distracted by the central mystery of these events: How is it that so many knowledge workers end up with workloads calibrated to the exact edge of the overhead tax tipping point?</p>\n<p>They exist at that point of maximum sustainable overhead tax that seems to represent the worst of all configurations, as it maintains the pain of having too much to do, but keeps this pain just manageable enough to avoid reform.</p>\n<p>How do knowledge workers decide when to say no to the constant bombardment of incoming requests? In the modern office context, they tend to rely on stress as a default heuristic for moderation. If you turn down a Zoom meeting invitation, there’s a social-capital cost, as you’re causing some mild harm to a colleague and potentially signaling yourself to be uncooperative or a loafer. But, if you feel sufficiently stressed about your workload, this cost might become acceptable: you feel confident that you’re close to becoming unsustainably busy, and this provides psychological cover to skip the Zoom. You need to feel sufficient personal distress to justify the distress saying no might generate in the other party.</p>\n<p>toiling at maximum capacity greatly reduces the rate at which we accomplish useful things, as it chokes our schedule in administrative kudzu and splinters our attention into fragments too small to support original thinking.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-limit-the-big\">Proposition: Limit the Big</h4>\n<p>He didn’t resolve, in some generic fashion, to try to take on less; he instead put in place specific rules (e.g., no conferences), habits (e.g., work from home as much as possible), and even ploys (e.g., trickling out his already completed research)—all directed toward minimizing the number of big items tugging at his attention.</p>\n<p>Intentional limits set concurrently at all three of these scales are more likely to succeed than focusing on just one scale in isolation.</p>\n<h5 id=\"limit-missions\">LIMIT MISSIONS</h5>\n<p>The term <strong>mission</strong> can sound grandiose. For our purposes, we’ll demote it to a more pragmatic definition: any ongoing goal or service that directs your professional life.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>It’s hard to specify the optimal number of missions, but generally, less is better than more. There’s a romance to focusing on a single pursuit, but this level of simplicity is typically accessible only to the most purely creative fields&hellip;.Two or three missions are more tractable and still quite minimalist.</p>\n<h5 id=\"limit-projects\">LIMIT PROJECTS</h5>\n<p>Missions require that you initiate “projects,” which is my term for any work-related initiative that cannot be completed in a single session. Some projects you complete once and then are done, such as updating the sales copy on a product website. Other projects are ongoing, meaning they unfold without any clear stopping point, such as answering support queries from clients. Projects create many of the concrete tasks that take up your time during the day. It follows that limiting them is critical to limiting your overall work volume.</p>\n<p>If you instead have a reputation as someone who is careful about managing their time and can quantify your busyness more concretely, you have a better chance of avoiding the new work. When you say, “I don’t see any really significant swaths of open time to work on something like this for at least three weeks, and in the meantime, I have five other projects competing for my schedule,” it’s hard for someone to rebut you, unless they’re willing to challenge your calculations, or demand that you expand your working hours to accommodate their specific request.</p>\n<p>To gain this credibility, I recommend, at first, when considering a new project, you estimate how much time it will require and then go find that time and schedule it on your calendar. Block off the hours as you would for a meeting. If you’re unable to find enough blank spaces in your schedule in the near future to easily fit the work, then you don’t have enough time for it. Either decline the project, or cancel something else to make room. The power of this approach is that you’re dealing with the reality of your time, not a gut feeling about how busy you are at the moment.</p>\n<p>You don’t have to continue pre-scheduling your projects in this manner indefinitely. After you’ve executed this strategy for a while, you’ll develop an instinct for roughly how many commitments you can maintain at any point without overtaxing your time. Going forward, it becomes sufficient to just track your current project tally, and reject new work once you pass your limit—making adjustments as needed, of course, for unusually busy periods.</p>\n<h5 id=\"limit-daily-goals\">LIMIT DAILY GOALS</h5>\n<p>We’ve arrived at the smallest scale of work that we’ll consider for our limiting strategies: the projects you decide to make progress on during the current day. My recommendation here is simple: work on at most one project per day.</p>\n<p>There’s a calibrated steadiness to working on just one major initiative a day. Real progress accrues, while anxiety is subdued.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-contain-the-small\">Proposition: Contain the Small</h4>\n<p>I enjoy collecting these stories of glamorous defenses against distraction. I find them aspirational, even if they remain, in their specifics, often laughably unobtainable.</p>\n<p>This advice is unified by the notion of containment.</p>\n<h5 id=\"put-tasks-on-autopilot\">PUT TASKS ON AUTOPILOT</h5>\n<p>In the context of knowledge work, it turns out, autopilot schedules provide an effective means to contain tasks. Instead of setting regular times each week for completing school assignments, you can set times for accomplishing specific categories of regularly occurring tasks.</p>\n<p>A key refinement to support this task-centric version of autopilot scheduling is to leverage rituals and locations.</p>\n<p>Containing tasks is not about escaping the small. It’s instead about making these efforts as painless as possible. Seeking, as I once put it, that “low-stress sweet spot.”</p>\n<h5 id=\"synchronize\">SYNCHRONIZE</h5>\n<p>There are many explanations for Mann’s disillusionment with detailed task management systems like GTD. The one I want to highlight here is perhaps the most fundamental: they didn’t work. To be fair, they weren’t entirely ineffective. Moving obligations out of your mind and into trusted systems—the foundation of GTD—will make you less anxious and more organized.</p>\n<p>transformed office collaboration into an ongoing, haphazard bazaar of asynchronous, back-and-forth messaging—a colleague asks you to handle something, you reply to clarify what he means, you then write another colleague to gather the needed information, but based on her response, you realize you don’t fully understand the task, so you send a new message to the original requester, and so on. Multiply these drawn-out interactions by dozens of concurrent open loops, and soon you’re spending most of your time managing conversations, not executing individual tasks.</p>\n<p>A direct strategy for reducing collaboration overhead is to replace asynchronous communication with real-time conversations.</p>\n<p>The right balance can be found in using office hours: regularly scheduled sessions for quick discussions that can be used to resolve many different issues. Set aside the same thirty to sixty minutes every afternoon, and advertise this time to your colleagues and clients.</p>\n<p>If someone sends you an ambiguous message, instead of letting it instigate yet another stretched-out volley of back-and-forth missives, reply, “Happy to help! Grab me during one of my upcoming office hours and we’ll figure out the details.”</p>\n<p>This approach can also be adapted for teams in the form of a related strategy that I call docket-clearing meetings. Like office hours, these meetings happen at the same times on the same days, each week. Unlike office hours, they’re attended by your entire team. During these sessions, your team churns through any pending tasks that require collaboration or clarification. The group moves through the tasks one at a time, figuring out for each what exactly needs to be done, who is working on it, and what information they need from others. An easy way to organize these sessions is to maintain a shared document of tasks to discuss. Team members can add items to the list as they come up in between meetings. One thirty-minute docket-clearing session can save a team from hours of highly distracting inbox checking and back-and-forth emailing.</p>\n<p>The cure isn’t to be found in smarter task systems, but instead in a return to something simpler, and more human: regular conversation.</p>\n<h5 id=\"make-other-people-work-more\">MAKE OTHER PEOPLE WORK MORE</h5>\n<p>Create a public task list for each of the major categories of tasks you tackle in your job. You can use a shared document for this purpose. (If you’re feeling more advanced, a shared Trello board is perhaps even better.) When someone asks you to take on some small obligation, direct them to add it themselves to the relevant shared task list; writing it, for example, into the shared doc, or creating a new card for it on the shared Trello board. Critically, make it clear that all of the information you’ll need to complete the task should be included in their entry.</p>\n<p>Another strategy along these lines is to introduce processes that require your colleagues or clients to do more of the work associated with a given task.</p>\n<p>At first, these strategies for making the burden of task assignments more symmetric can feel self-indulgent. You might even worry that others will be offended by your brashness. In reality, however, if you’re diplomatic in your phrasing, and deploy sufficient self-deprecation, you can introduce these systems without attracting too much ire. Indeed, your peers might end up appreciating the added structure, as it provides clarity about how or when their requested work will actually be accomplished.</p>\n<h5 id=\"avoid-task-engines\">AVOID TASK ENGINES</h5>\n<p>When selecting new projects, assess your options by the number of weekly requests, questions, or small chores you expect the project to generate. Prioritize options that minimize this number.</p>\n<h5 id=\"spend-money\">SPEND MONEY</h5>\n<p>Every effective entrepreneur I know shares a similar commitment to paying people who know what they’re doing so they don’t have to do the work, at a lower level of quality, all by themselves.</p>\n<h4 id=\"interlude-what-about-overwhelmed-parents\">Interlude: What about Overwhelmed Parents?</h4>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-pull-instead-of-push\">Proposition: Pull Instead of Push</h4>\n<p>In a push-based process, each stage pushes work onward to the next as soon as it’s done. In a pull-based process, by contrast, each stage pulls in new work only when it’s ready for it.</p>\n<p>Shifting to a pull-based operation made backlogs impossible: the pace of the pipeline would adapt to whatever stage was running slowest. This transparency, in turn, helped the workers identify places where the system was out of balance.</p>\n<p>The key is to simulate a pull-based assignment system in such a way that the people you work with don’t even realize you’re trying something new. What follows is a three-step strategy for implementing a simulated pull system as an individual without control over the habits of your colleagues or clients.</p>\n<h5 id=\"simulated-pull-part-1-holding-tank-and-active-lists\">SIMULATED PULL, PART 1: HOLDING TANK AND ACTIVE LISTS</h5>\n<p>The first step in simulating a pull-based workflow is tracking all projects to which you’re currently committed on a list divided into two sections: “holding tank” and “active.”</p>\n<p>When a new project is pushed toward you, place it in the holding-pen section of your list. There is no bound to the size of your holding tank.</p>\n<p>The active position of the list, by contrast, should be limited to three projects at most.</p>\n<p>When scheduling your time, you should focus your attention only on the projects on your active list.</p>\n<h5 id=\"simulated-pull-part-2-intake-procedure\">SIMULATED PULL, PART 2: INTAKE PROCEDURE</h5>\n<p>When adding a new project to your holding tank, it’s important to update the source of this new obligation about what they should expect. To do so, send an acknowledgment message that formally acknowledges the project that you’re committing to complete, but that also includes the following three pieces of extra information: (1) a request for any additional details you need from the source before you can start the project, (2) a count of the number of existing projects already on your lists, and (3) an estimate of when you expect to complete this new work.</p>\n<p>label the project with the time estimate you included in your acknowledgment message so you won’t later forget. Notice, when making this estimate, you can look at the estimates on all of your existing projects to help inform a realistic prediction.</p>\n<p>If you fall behind on a project, update your estimate and inform the person who originally sent you the work about the delay. The key here is transparency. Be clear about what’s going on, and deliver on your promises, even if these promises have to change. Never let a project just drop through the cracks and hope it will be forgotten. If your colleagues and clients don’t trust you to deliver, they won’t stop bothering you.</p>\n<h5 id=\"simulated-pull-part-3-list-cleaning\">SIMULATED PULL, PART 3: LIST CLEANING</h5>\n<p>In these cases, remove the outdated projects from your lists. But before you do so, send a quick note to their original source letting them know. Simulating a pull-based workflow works only if you maintain transparency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-work-at-a-natural-pace\">4 WORK AT A NATURAL PACE</h3>\n<p>It’s true that many of us have bosses or clients making demands, but they don’t always dictate the details of our daily schedules—it’s often our own anxieties that play the role of the fiercest taskmaster.</p>\n<p>PRINCIPLE #2: WORK AT A NATURAL PACE Don’t rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance.</p>\n<p>Monotonous, all-day effort is unavoidable when you’re harvesting crops or working an assembly-line station—the best you can do is mitigate its worst impacts with rituals and laws. It’s less clear that this unvarying intensity is equally as unavoidable in knowledge work.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-take-longer\">Proposition: Take Longer</h4>\n<h5 id=\"make-a-five-year-plan\">MAKE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN</h5>\n<h5 id=\"double-your-project-timelines\">DOUBLE YOUR PROJECT TIMELINES</h5>\n<p>take whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for upcoming projects, and then double their length.</p>\n<p>A reality of personal productivity is that humans are not great at estimating the time required for cognitive endeavors. We’re wired to understand the demands of tangible efforts, like crafting a hand ax, or gathering edible plants. When it comes to planning pursuits for which we lack physical intuition, however, we’re guessing more than we realize, leading us to gravitate toward best-case scenarios for how long things might take.</p>\n<p>The fear here, of course, is that by doubling these timelines, you’ll drastically reduce what you accomplish. But your original plans were never realistic or sustainable in the first place.</p>\n<p>A key tenet of slow productivity is that grand achievement is built on the steady accumulation of modest results over time. This path is long. Pace yourself.</p>\n<h5 id=\"simplify-your-workday\">SIMPLIFY YOUR WORKDAY</h5>\n<p>To create more reasonable workdays, I have two suggestions: first, reduce the number of tasks you schedule, and second, reduce the number of appointments on your calendar. In other words, cut back on what you plan to accomplish while increasing your available time.</p>\n<p>The first suggestion is simple to implement: apply the heuristic of reducing whatever task list you come up with for a given day by somewhere between 25 and 50 percent.</p>\n<p>When it comes to taming appointments, a good target is to ensure that no more than half of the hours in any single day are dedicated to meetings or calls. The simplest way to meet this mark is to declare certain hours to be protected (e.g., no meetings before noon).</p>\n<p>A subtler alternative is to instead implement a “one for you, one for me” strategy. Every time you add a meeting to your calendar for a given day, find an equal amount of time that day to protect.</p>\n<h5 id=\"forgive-yourself\">FORGIVE YOURSELF</h5>\n<p>It’s tempting to react to these periods of depressed productivity by assigning yourself a penance of crushing busyness. If you’re exhausted, you tell yourself, you can’t be accused of laziness.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-embrace-seasonality\">Proposition: Embrace Seasonality</h4>\n<p>To work without change or rest all year would have seemed unusual to most of our ancestors. Seasonality was deeply integrated into the human experience.</p>\n<h5 id=\"schedule-slow-seasons\">SCHEDULE SLOW SEASONS</h5>\n<p>If we’re willing to push aside all of this digital posturing, at the core of quiet quitting is a pragmatic observation: you have more control than you think over the intensity of your workload.</p>\n<p>What if, for example, you decided to quiet quit a single season each year: maybe July and August, or that distracted period between Thanksgiving and the New Year?</p>\n<p>For this idea to work, you should, if possible, arrange for major projects to wrap up before your simulated offseason begins, and wait to initiate major new projects until after it ends.</p>\n<p>An advanced tactic here is to take on a highly visible but low-impact project during this season that you can use to temporarily deflect new work that comes your way: “I’m happy to lead that internal review project, but I’m really focused this month on mastering this new marketing software, so let’s wait until the New Year to get started.” The key is to choose a deflection project that itself doesn’t require a lot of collaboration, meetings, or urgent messages. Solo writing or research projects work well here.</p>\n<h5 id=\"define-a-shorter-work-year\">DEFINE A SHORTER WORK YEAR</h5>\n<h5 id=\"implement-small-seasonality\">IMPLEMENT “SMALL SEASONALITY”</h5>\n<p><strong>No Meeting Mondays</strong></p>\n<p>You don’t need to make a public announcement about this decision. When people ask when you’re free for a meeting or a call, just stop suggesting slots on that particular day.</p>\n<p>Other days, of course, could also work just as well. Perhaps keeping Fridays clear of meetings works better for the pace of your particular job, or you find more value in maintaining a clear day in the middle of the week. The key to this idea is maintaining some bastion of peace amid an otherwise cluttered calendar.</p>\n<p><strong>See a Matinee Once a Month</strong></p>\n<p>My suggestion is to try to put aside an afternoon to escape to the movies once per month, protecting the time on your calendar well in advance so it doesn’t get snagged by a last-minute appointment.</p>\n<p>To receive the benefits of this advice, it’s not necessary that you see a film. Other activities can work as well. In my own experience, for example, I’ve also found similar benefits visiting museums and going on hikes. The key observation here is that even a modest schedule of weekday escapes can be sufficient to diminish the exhaustion of an otherwise metronome-regular routine.</p>\n<p><strong>Schedule Rest Projects</strong></p>\n<p>The idea is simple: after putting aside time on your calendar for a major work project, schedule in the days or weeks immediately following it time to pursue something leisurely and unrelated to your work.</p>\n<p>The key is to obtain a proportional balance. Hard leads to fun. The more hardness you face, the more fun you will enjoy soon after. Even if these rest projects are relatively small compared with the work that triggers them, this back-and-forth rhythm can still induce a sustaining experience of variation.</p>\n<p><strong>Work in Cycles</strong></p>\n<p>Adopting some notion of cycles in your own work can be understood as a more structured implementation of both the rest project and seasonal quiet quitting strategies described above.</p>\n<h4 id=\"interlude-didnt-jack-kerouac-write-on-the-road-in-three-weeks\">Interlude: Didn’t Jack Kerouac Write On the Road in Three Weeks?</h4>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-work-poetically\">Proposition: Work Poetically</h4>\n<p>sometimes cultivating a natural pace isn’t just about the time you dedicate to a project, but also the context in which the work is completed.</p>\n<h5 id=\"match-your-space-to-your-work\">MATCH YOUR SPACE TO YOUR WORK</h5>\n<p>Whenever I see a generic home office, with its white bookcases and office-supply-store wall hangings, I can’t help but think about all the ways in which its inhabitant could remake the setting into something more tailored to the work it supports.</p>\n<h5 id=\"strange-is-better-than-stylish\">STRANGE IS BETTER THAN STYLISH</h5>\n<p>The problem is that the home is filled with the familiar, and the familiar snares our attention, destabilizing the subtle neuronal dance required to think clearly.</p>\n<p>When we pass the laundry basket outside our home office (aka our bedroom), our brain shifts toward a household-chores context, even when we would like to maintain focus on whatever pressing work needs to get done.</p>\n<p>What counted was their disconnection from the familiar.</p>\n<h5 id=\"rituals-should-be-striking\">RITUALS SHOULD BE STRIKING</h5>\n<p>In this account of ancient Greek Mystery cults, we learn something important about rituals in general. Their power is found not in the specifics of their activities but in the transformative effect these activities have on the mind. The more striking and notable the behaviors, the better chance they have of inducing useful changes.</p>\n<p>My advice here has two parts. First, form your own personalized rituals around the work you find most important. Second, in doing so, ensure your rituals are sufficiently striking to effectively shift your mental state into something more supportive of your goals.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-obsess-over-quality\">5 OBSESS OVER QUALITY</h3>\n<p>She adopted a motto for her intentional approach: “Hardwood grows slowly.”</p>\n<p>PRINCIPLE #3: OBSESS OVER QUALITY Obsess over the quality of what you produce, even if this means missing opportunities in the short term. Leverage the value of these results to gain more and more freedom in your efforts over the long term.</p>\n<p>Doing fewer things and working at a natural pace are both absolutely necessary components of this philosophy, but if those earlier principles are implemented on their own, without an accompanying obsession with quality, they might serve only to fray your relationship to work over time—casting your professional efforts as an imposition that you must tame.</p>\n<p>the manager has to lead a well-functioning team.</p>\n<p>quality turns out to be connected in unexpected ways to our desire to escape pseudo-productivity and embrace something slower.</p>\n<p>Once you commit to doing something very well, busyness becomes intolerable. In other words, this third principle helps you stick with the first.</p>\n<p>The marketplace doesn’t care about your personal interest in slowing down. If you want more control over your schedule, you need something to offer in return.</p>\n<p>We’ve become so used to the idea that the only reward for getting better is moving toward higher income and increased responsibilities that we forget that the fruits of pursuing quality can also be harvested in the form of a more sustainable lifestyle.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-improve-your-taste\">Proposition: Improve Your Taste</h4>\n<p>In his exposition, Glass focuses on the gap that often exists between taste and ability—especially early on in a creative career. It’s easier to learn to recognize what’s good, he notes, than to master the skills required to meet this standard. &hellip; His exhortation to those just beginning their careers is to keep putting in the work, as it’s only through this deliberate effort that the gap will close.</p>\n<p>When we idolize an Ira Glass–style obsession with quality, we often overlook the importance of developing our internal filters first. It’s more exciting to focus on effort, drive, and diligence—but no amount of grinding away at your proverbial radio program or novel manuscript will lead to brilliance if you don’t yet have a good understanding of what brilliance could mean.</p>\n<h5 id=\"become-a-cinephile\">BECOME A CINEPHILE</h5>\n<p>There’s nothing special about cinema in this case study. The bigger observation is that there can be utility in immersing yourself in appreciation for fields that are different from your own.</p>\n<p>Understand your own field, to be sure, but also focus on what’s great about other domains. It’s here that you can find a more flexible source of inspiration, a reminder of what makes the act of creation so exciting in the first place.</p>\n<h5 id=\"start-your-own-inklings\">START YOUR OWN INKLINGS</h5>\n<p>When you gather with other people who share similar professional ambitions, the collective taste of the group can be superior to that of any individual. This follows, in part, from the diversity of approaches that people take toward creation in a given field. When you combine the opinions of multiple practitioners of your craft, more possibilities and nuance emerge. There’s also a focusing effect that comes from performing for a crowd.</p>\n<h5 id=\"buy-a-fifty-dollar-notebook\">BUY A FIFTY-DOLLAR NOTEBOOK</h5>\n<p>Knowing how much I had spent, I figured, would make me more careful about what I wrote on its archival-quality pages, which would force me to be more structured and careful in my thinking.</p>\n<p>quality tools can increase the quality of your work</p>\n<p>Part of the power of these setups is found in their complexity, which puts the user in a specialized mindset, ready to do the hard work of writing efficient programs.</p>\n<h4 id=\"interlude-what-about-perfectionism\">Interlude: What about Perfectionism?</h4>\n<p>Quality matters, but if it becomes everything, you may never finish.</p>\n<p>When your output is only one step among many on a collaborative path toward creative progress, the pressure to get everything just right is reduced. Your goal is instead reduced to knocking the metaphorical ball back over the net with enough force for the game to proceed. Here we find as good a general strategy for balancing obsession and perfectionism as I’ve seen: Give yourself enough time to produce something great, but not unlimited time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"proposition-bet-on-yourself\">Proposition: Bet on Yourself</h4>\n<p>The goal in betting on yourself, as you’ll see, is to push yourself to a new level without accidentally also pushing yourself into an unnaturally busy workload.</p>\n<h5 id=\"write-after-the-kids-go-to-bed\">WRITE AFTER THE KIDS GO TO BED</h5>\n<p>The stakes here are modest: If you fail to reach the quality level that you seek, the main consequence is that during a limited period you’ve lost time you could have dedicated to more rewarding (or restful) activities. But this cost is sufficiently annoying to motivate increased attention toward your efforts.</p>\n<p>This spare time strategy, of course, is not a sustainable way to work in the long term. Sacrificing too many of your leisure hours to extra work can violate both of the first two principles of slow productivity. But when deployed in moderation, dedicated to a specific project for a temporary period, this act of giving up something meaningful in pursuit of higher quality can become an effective bet on yourself.</p>\n<h5 id=\"reduce-your-salary\">REDUCE YOUR SALARY</h5>\n<p>The problem, of course, is that for every Grisham there are a dozen other aspiring writers—or entrepreneurs, or artists—who end up slinking back to their old jobs, chastened and deeper in debt than when they started.</p>\n<p>Don’t haphazardly quit your job to pursue a more meaningful project. Wait instead to make a major change until you have concrete evidence that your new interest satisfies the following two properties: first, people are willing to give you money for it, and second, you can replicate the result.</p>\n<p>In entrepreneurship, by contrast, this might mean that your side hustle generates a steady stream of sales. Once you’ve passed these thresholds, however, take action. This doesn’t necessarily mean quitting your current job completely. It might instead mean that you reduce your hours, or take an unpaid leave.</p>\n<h5 id=\"announce-a-schedule\">ANNOUNCE A SCHEDULE</h5>\n<p>If you announce your work in advance to people you know, you’ll have created expectations. If you fail to produce something notable, you’ll pay a social cost in terms of embarrassment.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> this may not work the same for everyone. Know yourself. It could cause you to quit. It may depend on the type of commitment. (Investment, promise, etc.)</p>\n<h5 id=\"attract-an-investor\">ATTRACT AN INVESTOR</h5>\n<p>When someone has invested in your project, you’ll experience amplified motivation to pay back their trust.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>Slowing down isn’t about protesting work. It’s instead about finding a better way to do it.</p>\n<p>The philosophy I developed is meant primarily for those who engage in skilled labor with significant amounts of autonomy.

Do fewer things. 2. Work at a natural pace. 3. Obsess over quality.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nthis philosophy rejects busyness, seeing overload as an obstacle to producing results that matter, not a badge of pride. It also posits that professional efforts should unfold at a more varied and humane pace, with hard periods counterbalanced by relaxation at many different timescales, and that a focus on impressive quality, not performative activity, should underpin everything.\n\n\n## Part 1 FOUNDATIONS\n\n\n### 1 THE RISE AND FALL OF PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY\n\n\nIt’s hard to overemphasize how unusual it is that an economic sector as large as knowledge work lacks useful standard definitions of productivity.\n\n\nIn the absence of more sophisticated measures of effectiveness, we also gravitate away from deeper efforts toward shallower, more concrete tasks that can be more easily checked off a to-do list. Long work sessions that don’t immediately produce obvious contrails of effort become a source of anxiety—it’s safer to chime in on email threads and “jump on” calls than to put your head down and create a bold new strategy.\n\n\n__PSEUDO-PRODUCTIVITY__ The use of visible activity as the primary means of approximating actual productive effort.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nMany people would rather pretend to be busy in an air-conditioned office than stamp sheet metal all day on a hot factory floor.\n\n\n### 2 A SLOWER ALTERNATIVE\n\n\nThere’s a personal satisfaction in grimly pointing out the flaws in a system, but sustainable change, Petrini came to believe, requires providing people with an enjoyable and life-affirming alternative.\n\n\nThere’s a temptation in activism to propose radically new ideas, as this preserves the utopian possibility of a pristine solution. Petrini recognized, however, that when it came to presenting an appealing alternative to fast food, he would be wise to draw from traditional food cultures that had developed through trial-and-error experimentation over many generations.\n\n\nOnce isolated, Petrini’s two big ideas for developing reform movements—focus on alternatives to what’s wrong and draw these solutions from time-tested traditions—are obviously not restricted to food in any fundamental sense. They can apply to any setting in which a haphazard modernism is conflicting with the human experience. This claim is validated by the many new slow movements that arose in the wake of Slow Food’s original success, targeting other aspects of our culture that were suffering from an unthinking haste.\n\n\nThis sudden interest in workplace experimentation is both welcome and needed, as much about how we work in the knowledge sector today is ossified into tradition and conventions, some of which are arbitrary and some of which are borrowed from different, older types of work.\n\n\nMoves to maintain telecommuting or reduce the workweek help blunt some of the worst side effects of pseudo-productivity but do little to address the root problem itself.\n\n\na more sustainable response to the burnout crisis facing knowledge work would be to offer an appealing alternative. This would require moving beyond attempts to simply constrain pseudo-productivity to instead propose a brand-new vision of what productivity can mean.\n\n\n__KNOWLEDGE WORK__ (GENERAL DEFINITION) The economic activity in which knowledge is transformed into an artifact with market value through the application of cognitive effort.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nit’s worth noting that the general mindset and mood conveyed in these tales are also of stand-alone value. Following Petrini’s lead, I’m convinced that one of the best ways to truly introduce you to the “lost art of accomplishment without burnout” is to immerse you in the world of those who successfully built their lives around this goal.\n\n\nI want to reassure you that slow productivity doesn’t ask that you extinguish ambition. Humans derive great satisfaction from being good at what they do and producing useful things. This philosophy can be understood as providing a more sustainable path toward these achievements.\n\n\nThough this book is about knowledge work productivity in general, it targets in particular anyone who has a reasonable degree of autonomy in their job. This obviously includes freelancers, solopreneurs, and those who run small businesses. Pseudo-productivity’s presence in these particular settings is not due to a boss’s demands but is instead largely self-imposed, which opens up vast potential for individual experimentation. My imagined audience, however, also includes those who might work for larger employers but still enjoy significant freedom in how they go about their work.\n\n\nThis is not to say that slow productivity cannot one day reform these corners of knowledge work as well (see my discussion in the conclusion of this book about my broader vision for the future of this movement), but every revolution needs a starting point, and for something as momentous as rethinking the very notion of productivity itself, it makes sense to focus at first on those for whom self-experimentation is possible.\n\n\n## Part 2 PRINCIPLES\n\n\n### 3 DO FEWER THINGS\n\n\nPRINCIPLE #1: DO FEWER THINGS Strive to reduce your obligations to the point where you can easily imagine accomplishing them with time to spare. Leverage this reduced load to more fully embrace and advance the small number of projects that matter most.\n\n\nI found myself distracted by the central mystery of these events: How is it that so many knowledge workers end up with workloads calibrated to the exact edge of the overhead tax tipping point?\n\n\nThey exist at that point of maximum sustainable overhead tax that seems to represent the worst of all configurations, as it maintains the pain of having too much to do, but keeps this pain just manageable enough to avoid reform.\n\n\nHow do knowledge workers decide when to say no to the constant bombardment of incoming requests? In the modern office context, they tend to rely on stress as a default heuristic for moderation. If you turn down a Zoom meeting invitation, there’s a social-capital cost, as you’re causing some mild harm to a colleague and potentially signaling yourself to be uncooperative or a loafer. But, if you feel sufficiently stressed about your workload, this cost might become acceptable: you feel confident that you’re close to becoming unsustainably busy, and this provides psychological cover to skip the Zoom. You need to feel sufficient personal distress to justify the distress saying no might generate in the other party.\n\n\ntoiling at maximum capacity greatly reduces the rate at which we accomplish useful things, as it chokes our schedule in administrative kudzu and splinters our attention into fragments too small to support original thinking.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Limit the Big\n\n\nHe didn’t resolve, in some generic fashion, to try to take on less; he instead put in place specific rules (e.g., no conferences), habits (e.g., work from home as much as possible), and even ploys (e.g., trickling out his already completed research)—all directed toward minimizing the number of big items tugging at his attention.\n\n\nIntentional limits set concurrently at all three of these scales are more likely to succeed than focusing on just one scale in isolation.\n\n\n##### LIMIT MISSIONS\n\n\nThe term __mission__ can sound grandiose. For our purposes, we’ll demote it to a more pragmatic definition: any ongoing goal or service that directs your professional life.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nIt’s hard to specify the optimal number of missions, but generally, less is better than more. There’s a romance to focusing on a single pursuit, but this level of simplicity is typically accessible only to the most purely creative fields....Two or three missions are more tractable and still quite minimalist.\n\n\n##### LIMIT PROJECTS\n\n\nMissions require that you initiate “projects,” which is my term for any work-related initiative that cannot be completed in a single session. Some projects you complete once and then are done, such as updating the sales copy on a product website. Other projects are ongoing, meaning they unfold without any clear stopping point, such as answering support queries from clients. Projects create many of the concrete tasks that take up your time during the day. It follows that limiting them is critical to limiting your overall work volume.\n\n\nIf you instead have a reputation as someone who is careful about managing their time and can quantify your busyness more concretely, you have a better chance of avoiding the new work. When you say, “I don’t see any really significant swaths of open time to work on something like this for at least three weeks, and in the meantime, I have five other projects competing for my schedule,” it’s hard for someone to rebut you, unless they’re willing to challenge your calculations, or demand that you expand your working hours to accommodate their specific request.\n\n\nTo gain this credibility, I recommend, at first, when considering a new project, you estimate how much time it will require and then go find that time and schedule it on your calendar. Block off the hours as you would for a meeting. If you’re unable to find enough blank spaces in your schedule in the near future to easily fit the work, then you don’t have enough time for it. Either decline the project, or cancel something else to make room. The power of this approach is that you’re dealing with the reality of your time, not a gut feeling about how busy you are at the moment.\n\n\nYou don’t have to continue pre-scheduling your projects in this manner indefinitely. After you’ve executed this strategy for a while, you’ll develop an instinct for roughly how many commitments you can maintain at any point without overtaxing your time. Going forward, it becomes sufficient to just track your current project tally, and reject new work once you pass your limit—making adjustments as needed, of course, for unusually busy periods.\n\n\n##### LIMIT DAILY GOALS\n\n\nWe’ve arrived at the smallest scale of work that we’ll consider for our limiting strategies: the projects you decide to make progress on during the current day. My recommendation here is simple: work on at most one project per day.\n\n\nThere’s a calibrated steadiness to working on just one major initiative a day. Real progress accrues, while anxiety is subdued.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Contain the Small\n\n\nI enjoy collecting these stories of glamorous defenses against distraction. I find them aspirational, even if they remain, in their specifics, often laughably unobtainable.\n\n\nThis advice is unified by the notion of containment.\n\n\n##### PUT TASKS ON AUTOPILOT\n\n\nIn the context of knowledge work, it turns out, autopilot schedules provide an effective means to contain tasks. Instead of setting regular times each week for completing school assignments, you can set times for accomplishing specific categories of regularly occurring tasks.\n\n\nA key refinement to support this task-centric version of autopilot scheduling is to leverage rituals and locations.\n\n\nContaining tasks is not about escaping the small. It’s instead about making these efforts as painless as possible. Seeking, as I once put it, that “low-stress sweet spot.”\n\n\n##### SYNCHRONIZE\n\n\nThere are many explanations for Mann’s disillusionment with detailed task management systems like GTD. The one I want to highlight here is perhaps the most fundamental: they didn’t work. To be fair, they weren’t entirely ineffective. Moving obligations out of your mind and into trusted systems—the foundation of GTD—will make you less anxious and more organized.\n\n\ntransformed office collaboration into an ongoing, haphazard bazaar of asynchronous, back-and-forth messaging—a colleague asks you to handle something, you reply to clarify what he means, you then write another colleague to gather the needed information, but based on her response, you realize you don’t fully understand the task, so you send a new message to the original requester, and so on. Multiply these drawn-out interactions by dozens of concurrent open loops, and soon you’re spending most of your time managing conversations, not executing individual tasks.\n\n\nA direct strategy for reducing collaboration overhead is to replace asynchronous communication with real-time conversations.\n\n\nThe right balance can be found in using office hours: regularly scheduled sessions for quick discussions that can be used to resolve many different issues. Set aside the same thirty to sixty minutes every afternoon, and advertise this time to your colleagues and clients.\n\n\nIf someone sends you an ambiguous message, instead of letting it instigate yet another stretched-out volley of back-and-forth missives, reply, “Happy to help! Grab me during one of my upcoming office hours and we’ll figure out the details.”\n\n\nThis approach can also be adapted for teams in the form of a related strategy that I call docket-clearing meetings. Like office hours, these meetings happen at the same times on the same days, each week. Unlike office hours, they’re attended by your entire team. During these sessions, your team churns through any pending tasks that require collaboration or clarification. The group moves through the tasks one at a time, figuring out for each what exactly needs to be done, who is working on it, and what information they need from others. An easy way to organize these sessions is to maintain a shared document of tasks to discuss. Team members can add items to the list as they come up in between meetings. One thirty-minute docket-clearing session can save a team from hours of highly distracting inbox checking and back-and-forth emailing.\n\n\nThe cure isn’t to be found in smarter task systems, but instead in a return to something simpler, and more human: regular conversation.\n\n\n##### MAKE OTHER PEOPLE WORK MORE\n\n\nCreate a public task list for each of the major categories of tasks you tackle in your job. You can use a shared document for this purpose. (If you’re feeling more advanced, a shared Trello board is perhaps even better.) When someone asks you to take on some small obligation, direct them to add it themselves to the relevant shared task list; writing it, for example, into the shared doc, or creating a new card for it on the shared Trello board. Critically, make it clear that all of the information you’ll need to complete the task should be included in their entry.\n\n\nAnother strategy along these lines is to introduce processes that require your colleagues or clients to do more of the work associated with a given task.\n\n\nAt first, these strategies for making the burden of task assignments more symmetric can feel self-indulgent. You might even worry that others will be offended by your brashness. In reality, however, if you’re diplomatic in your phrasing, and deploy sufficient self-deprecation, you can introduce these systems without attracting too much ire. Indeed, your peers might end up appreciating the added structure, as it provides clarity about how or when their requested work will actually be accomplished.\n\n\n##### AVOID TASK ENGINES\n\n\nWhen selecting new projects, assess your options by the number of weekly requests, questions, or small chores you expect the project to generate. Prioritize options that minimize this number.\n\n\n##### SPEND MONEY\n\n\nEvery effective entrepreneur I know shares a similar commitment to paying people who know what they’re doing so they don’t have to do the work, at a lower level of quality, all by themselves.\n\n\n#### Interlude: What about Overwhelmed Parents?\n\n\n#### Proposition: Pull Instead of Push\n\n\nIn a push-based process, each stage pushes work onward to the next as soon as it’s done. In a pull-based process, by contrast, each stage pulls in new work only when it’s ready for it.\n\n\nShifting to a pull-based operation made backlogs impossible: the pace of the pipeline would adapt to whatever stage was running slowest. This transparency, in turn, helped the workers identify places where the system was out of balance.\n\n\nThe key is to simulate a pull-based assignment system in such a way that the people you work with don’t even realize you’re trying something new. What follows is a three-step strategy for implementing a simulated pull system as an individual without control over the habits of your colleagues or clients.\n\n\n##### SIMULATED PULL, PART 1: HOLDING TANK AND ACTIVE LISTS\n\n\nThe first step in simulating a pull-based workflow is tracking all projects to which you’re currently committed on a list divided into two sections: “holding tank” and “active.”\n\n\nWhen a new project is pushed toward you, place it in the holding-pen section of your list. There is no bound to the size of your holding tank.\n\n\nThe active position of the list, by contrast, should be limited to three projects at most.\n\n\nWhen scheduling your time, you should focus your attention only on the projects on your active list.\n\n\n##### SIMULATED PULL, PART 2: INTAKE PROCEDURE\n\n\nWhen adding a new project to your holding tank, it’s important to update the source of this new obligation about what they should expect. To do so, send an acknowledgment message that formally acknowledges the project that you’re committing to complete, but that also includes the following three pieces of extra information: (1) a request for any additional details you need from the source before you can start the project, (2) a count of the number of existing projects already on your lists, and (3) an estimate of when you expect to complete this new work.\n\n\nlabel the project with the time estimate you included in your acknowledgment message so you won’t later forget. Notice, when making this estimate, you can look at the estimates on all of your existing projects to help inform a realistic prediction.\n\n\nIf you fall behind on a project, update your estimate and inform the person who originally sent you the work about the delay. The key here is transparency. Be clear about what’s going on, and deliver on your promises, even if these promises have to change. Never let a project just drop through the cracks and hope it will be forgotten. If your colleagues and clients don’t trust you to deliver, they won’t stop bothering you.\n\n\n##### SIMULATED PULL, PART 3: LIST CLEANING\n\n\nIn these cases, remove the outdated projects from your lists. But before you do so, send a quick note to their original source letting them know. Simulating a pull-based workflow works only if you maintain transparency.\n\n\n### 4 WORK AT A NATURAL PACE\n\n\nIt’s true that many of us have bosses or clients making demands, but they don’t always dictate the details of our daily schedules—it’s often our own anxieties that play the role of the fiercest taskmaster.\n\n\nPRINCIPLE #2: WORK AT A NATURAL PACE Don’t rush your most important work. Allow it instead to unfold along a sustainable timeline, with variations in intensity, in settings conducive to brilliance.\n\n\nMonotonous, all-day effort is unavoidable when you’re harvesting crops or working an assembly-line station—the best you can do is mitigate its worst impacts with rituals and laws. It’s less clear that this unvarying intensity is equally as unavoidable in knowledge work.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Take Longer\n\n\n##### MAKE A FIVE-YEAR PLAN\n\n\n##### DOUBLE YOUR PROJECT TIMELINES\n\n\ntake whatever timelines you first identify as reasonable for upcoming projects, and then double their length.\n\n\nA reality of personal productivity is that humans are not great at estimating the time required for cognitive endeavors. We’re wired to understand the demands of tangible efforts, like crafting a hand ax, or gathering edible plants. When it comes to planning pursuits for which we lack physical intuition, however, we’re guessing more than we realize, leading us to gravitate toward best-case scenarios for how long things might take.\n\n\nThe fear here, of course, is that by doubling these timelines, you’ll drastically reduce what you accomplish. But your original plans were never realistic or sustainable in the first place.\n\n\nA key tenet of slow productivity is that grand achievement is built on the steady accumulation of modest results over time. This path is long. Pace yourself.\n\n\n##### SIMPLIFY YOUR WORKDAY\n\n\nTo create more reasonable workdays, I have two suggestions: first, reduce the number of tasks you schedule, and second, reduce the number of appointments on your calendar. In other words, cut back on what you plan to accomplish while increasing your available time.\n\n\nThe first suggestion is simple to implement: apply the heuristic of reducing whatever task list you come up with for a given day by somewhere between 25 and 50 percent.\n\n\nWhen it comes to taming appointments, a good target is to ensure that no more than half of the hours in any single day are dedicated to meetings or calls. The simplest way to meet this mark is to declare certain hours to be protected (e.g., no meetings before noon).\n\n\nA subtler alternative is to instead implement a “one for you, one for me” strategy. Every time you add a meeting to your calendar for a given day, find an equal amount of time that day to protect.\n\n\n##### FORGIVE YOURSELF\n\n\nIt’s tempting to react to these periods of depressed productivity by assigning yourself a penance of crushing busyness. If you’re exhausted, you tell yourself, you can’t be accused of laziness.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Embrace Seasonality\n\n\nTo work without change or rest all year would have seemed unusual to most of our ancestors. Seasonality was deeply integrated into the human experience.\n\n\n##### SCHEDULE SLOW SEASONS\n\n\nIf we’re willing to push aside all of this digital posturing, at the core of quiet quitting is a pragmatic observation: you have more control than you think over the intensity of your workload.\n\n\nWhat if, for example, you decided to quiet quit a single season each year: maybe July and August, or that distracted period between Thanksgiving and the New Year?\n\n\nFor this idea to work, you should, if possible, arrange for major projects to wrap up before your simulated offseason begins, and wait to initiate major new projects until after it ends.\n\n\nAn advanced tactic here is to take on a highly visible but low-impact project during this season that you can use to temporarily deflect new work that comes your way: “I’m happy to lead that internal review project, but I’m really focused this month on mastering this new marketing software, so let’s wait until the New Year to get started.” The key is to choose a deflection project that itself doesn’t require a lot of collaboration, meetings, or urgent messages. Solo writing or research projects work well here.\n\n\n##### DEFINE A SHORTER WORK YEAR\n\n\n##### IMPLEMENT “SMALL SEASONALITY”\n\n\n**No Meeting Mondays**\n\n\nYou don’t need to make a public announcement about this decision. When people ask when you’re free for a meeting or a call, just stop suggesting slots on that particular day.\n\n\nOther days, of course, could also work just as well. Perhaps keeping Fridays clear of meetings works better for the pace of your particular job, or you find more value in maintaining a clear day in the middle of the week. The key to this idea is maintaining some bastion of peace amid an otherwise cluttered calendar.\n\n\n**See a Matinee Once a Month**\n\n\nMy suggestion is to try to put aside an afternoon to escape to the movies once per month, protecting the time on your calendar well in advance so it doesn’t get snagged by a last-minute appointment.\n\n\nTo receive the benefits of this advice, it’s not necessary that you see a film. Other activities can work as well. In my own experience, for example, I’ve also found similar benefits visiting museums and going on hikes. The key observation here is that even a modest schedule of weekday escapes can be sufficient to diminish the exhaustion of an otherwise metronome-regular routine.\n\n\n**Schedule Rest Projects**\n\n\nThe idea is simple: after putting aside time on your calendar for a major work project, schedule in the days or weeks immediately following it time to pursue something leisurely and unrelated to your work.\n\n\nThe key is to obtain a proportional balance. Hard leads to fun. The more hardness you face, the more fun you will enjoy soon after. Even if these rest projects are relatively small compared with the work that triggers them, this back-and-forth rhythm can still induce a sustaining experience of variation.\n\n\n**Work in Cycles**\n\n\nAdopting some notion of cycles in your own work can be understood as a more structured implementation of both the rest project and seasonal quiet quitting strategies described above.\n\n\n#### Interlude: Didn’t Jack Kerouac Write On the Road in Three Weeks?\n\n\n#### Proposition: Work Poetically\n\n\nsometimes cultivating a natural pace isn’t just about the time you dedicate to a project, but also the context in which the work is completed.\n\n\n##### MATCH YOUR SPACE TO YOUR WORK\n\n\nWhenever I see a generic home office, with its white bookcases and office-supply-store wall hangings, I can’t help but think about all the ways in which its inhabitant could remake the setting into something more tailored to the work it supports.\n\n\n##### STRANGE IS BETTER THAN STYLISH\n\n\nThe problem is that the home is filled with the familiar, and the familiar snares our attention, destabilizing the subtle neuronal dance required to think clearly.\n\n\nWhen we pass the laundry basket outside our home office (aka our bedroom), our brain shifts toward a household-chores context, even when we would like to maintain focus on whatever pressing work needs to get done.\n\n\nWhat counted was their disconnection from the familiar.\n\n\n##### RITUALS SHOULD BE STRIKING\n\n\nIn this account of ancient Greek Mystery cults, we learn something important about rituals in general. Their power is found not in the specifics of their activities but in the transformative effect these activities have on the mind. The more striking and notable the behaviors, the better chance they have of inducing useful changes.\n\n\nMy advice here has two parts. First, form your own personalized rituals around the work you find most important. Second, in doing so, ensure your rituals are sufficiently striking to effectively shift your mental state into something more supportive of your goals.\n\n\n### 5 OBSESS OVER QUALITY\n\n\nShe adopted a motto for her intentional approach: “Hardwood grows slowly.”\n\n\nPRINCIPLE #3: OBSESS OVER QUALITY Obsess over the quality of what you produce, even if this means missing opportunities in the short term. Leverage the value of these results to gain more and more freedom in your efforts over the long term.\n\n\nDoing fewer things and working at a natural pace are both absolutely necessary components of this philosophy, but if those earlier principles are implemented on their own, without an accompanying obsession with quality, they might serve only to fray your relationship to work over time—casting your professional efforts as an imposition that you must tame.\n\n\nthe manager has to lead a well-functioning team.\n\n\nquality turns out to be connected in unexpected ways to our desire to escape pseudo-productivity and embrace something slower.\n\n\nOnce you commit to doing something very well, busyness becomes intolerable. In other words, this third principle helps you stick with the first.\n\n\nThe marketplace doesn’t care about your personal interest in slowing down. If you want more control over your schedule, you need something to offer in return.\n\n\nWe’ve become so used to the idea that the only reward for getting better is moving toward higher income and increased responsibilities that we forget that the fruits of pursuing quality can also be harvested in the form of a more sustainable lifestyle.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Improve Your Taste\n\n\nIn his exposition, Glass focuses on the gap that often exists between taste and ability—especially early on in a creative career. It’s easier to learn to recognize what’s good, he notes, than to master the skills required to meet this standard. ... His exhortation to those just beginning their careers is to keep putting in the work, as it’s only through this deliberate effort that the gap will close.\n\n\nWhen we idolize an Ira Glass–style obsession with quality, we often overlook the importance of developing our internal filters first. It’s more exciting to focus on effort, drive, and diligence—but no amount of grinding away at your proverbial radio program or novel manuscript will lead to brilliance if you don’t yet have a good understanding of what brilliance could mean.\n\n\n##### BECOME A CINEPHILE\n\n\nThere’s nothing special about cinema in this case study. The bigger observation is that there can be utility in immersing yourself in appreciation for fields that are different from your own.\n\n\nUnderstand your own field, to be sure, but also focus on what’s great about other domains. It’s here that you can find a more flexible source of inspiration, a reminder of what makes the act of creation so exciting in the first place.\n\n\n##### START YOUR OWN INKLINGS\n\n\nWhen you gather with other people who share similar professional ambitions, the collective taste of the group can be superior to that of any individual. This follows, in part, from the diversity of approaches that people take toward creation in a given field. When you combine the opinions of multiple practitioners of your craft, more possibilities and nuance emerge. There’s also a focusing effect that comes from performing for a crowd.\n\n\n##### BUY A FIFTY-DOLLAR NOTEBOOK\n\n\nKnowing how much I had spent, I figured, would make me more careful about what I wrote on its archival-quality pages, which would force me to be more structured and careful in my thinking.\n\n\nquality tools can increase the quality of your work\n\n\nPart of the power of these setups is found in their complexity, which puts the user in a specialized mindset, ready to do the hard work of writing efficient programs.\n\n\n#### Interlude: What about Perfectionism?\n\n\nQuality matters, but if it becomes everything, you may never finish.\n\n\nWhen your output is only one step among many on a collaborative path toward creative progress, the pressure to get everything just right is reduced. Your goal is instead reduced to knocking the metaphorical ball back over the net with enough force for the game to proceed. Here we find as good a general strategy for balancing obsession and perfectionism as I’ve seen: Give yourself enough time to produce something great, but not unlimited time.\n\n\n#### Proposition: Bet on Yourself\n\n\nThe goal in betting on yourself, as you’ll see, is to push yourself to a new level without accidentally also pushing yourself into an unnaturally busy workload.\n\n\n##### WRITE AFTER THE KIDS GO TO BED\n\n\nThe stakes here are modest: If you fail to reach the quality level that you seek, the main consequence is that during a limited period you’ve lost time you could have dedicated to more rewarding (or restful) activities. But this cost is sufficiently annoying to motivate increased attention toward your efforts.\n\n\nThis spare time strategy, of course, is not a sustainable way to work in the long term. Sacrificing too many of your leisure hours to extra work can violate both of the first two principles of slow productivity. But when deployed in moderation, dedicated to a specific project for a temporary period, this act of giving up something meaningful in pursuit of higher quality can become an effective bet on yourself.\n\n\n##### REDUCE YOUR SALARY\n\n\nThe problem, of course, is that for every Grisham there are a dozen other aspiring writers—or entrepreneurs, or artists—who end up slinking back to their old jobs, chastened and deeper in debt than when they started.\n\n\nDon’t haphazardly quit your job to pursue a more meaningful project. Wait instead to make a major change until you have concrete evidence that your new interest satisfies the following two properties: first, people are willing to give you money for it, and second, you can replicate the result.\n\n\nIn entrepreneurship, by contrast, this might mean that your side hustle generates a steady stream of sales. Once you’ve passed these thresholds, however, take action. This doesn’t necessarily mean quitting your current job completely. It might instead mean that you reduce your hours, or take an unpaid leave.\n\n\n##### ANNOUNCE A SCHEDULE\n\n\nIf you announce your work in advance to people you know, you’ll have created expectations. If you fail to produce something notable, you’ll pay a social cost in terms of embarrassment.\n\n**Note:** this may not work the same for everyone. Know yourself. It could cause you to quit. It may depend on the type of commitment. (Investment, promise, etc.)\n\n\n##### ATTRACT AN INVESTOR\n\n\nWhen someone has invested in your project, you’ll experience amplified motivation to pay back their trust.\n\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n\nSlowing down isn’t about protesting work. It’s instead about finding a better way to do it.\n\n\nThe philosophy I developed is meant primarily for those who engage in skilled labor with significant amounts of autonomy. This target audience covers large swaths of the knowledge sector, including most freelancers, solopreneurs, and small-business owners, as well as those in fields like academia, where great freedom is afforded in how you choose and organize your efforts. If you fall into one of these categories, and are exhausted by the chronic overload and fast pacing of pseudo-productivity, then I urge you to consider radically transforming your professional life along the three principles I proposed. Do fewer things. Work at a natural pace. Obsess over quality.\n\n\nSlow productivity is one example of this thinking, but it shouldn’t be the only one. My long-term wish is that this movement kicks off many others, creating a marketplace of different concepts of productivity, each of which might apply to different types of workers or sensibilities.\n\n\nRevolution requires rebellions of many different scopes, from the practical and immediate to the fiery and ideological.\n\n\n\n",

This is known as <strong>neural entrainment</strong>, and it feels wonderful.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>But scientists have now unraveled many of the secrets of how successful conversations happen. They’ve learned that paying attention to someone’s body, alongside their voice, helps us hear them better. They have determined that how we ask a question sometimes matters more than what we ask. We’re better off, it seems, acknowledging social differences, rather than pretending they don’t exist. Every discussion is influenced by emotions, no matter how rational the topic at hand. When starting a dialogue, it helps to think of the discussion as a negotiation where the prize is figuring out what everyone wants. And, above all, the most important goal of any conversation is to connect.</p>\n<p>The first one is that many discussions are actually three different conversations. There are practical, decision-making conversations that focus on What’s This Really About? There are emotional conversations, which ask How Do We Feel? And there are social conversations that explore Who Are We? We are often moving in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds. However, if we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners, at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.</p>\n<p>Our goal, for the most meaningful discussions, should be to have a “learning conversation.” Specifically, we want to learn how the people around us see the world and help them understand our perspectives in turn.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-three-kinds-of-conversation\">THE THREE KINDS OF CONVERSATION</h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-matching-principle\">THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE</h3>\n<p>Some people consistently fail to synchronize with others, even when they’re speaking to close friends.

Other times, it happens within a group, or a large audience.

They repeated others’ ideas and were quick to admit their own confusion or make fun of themselves. They encouraged their groupmates (“That’s really smart! Tell me more about what you think!”) and laughed at others’ jokes. They didn’t stand out as particularly talkative or clever, but when they spoke, everyone listened closely. And, somehow, they made it easier for other people to speak up. They made conversations flow. Sievers began referring to these people as <strong>high centrality participants</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>But the most important difference between high centrality participants and everyone else was that the high centrality participants were constantly adjusting how they communicated, in order to match their companions.</p>\n<p>to become a supercommunicator, all we need to do is listen closely to what’s said and unsaid, ask the right questions, recognize and match others’ moods, and make our own feelings easy for others to perceive.</p>\n<p>The first mindset—the <strong>decision-making mindset</strong>—is associated with the What’s This Really About? conversation, and it’s active whenever we’re thinking about practical matters, such as making choices or analyzing plans.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>The second mindset—the <strong>emotional mindset</strong>—emerges when we discuss How Do We Feel? and draws on neural structures—the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, among others—that help shape our beliefs, emotions, and memories.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>The third conversational mindset—the <strong>social mindset</strong>—emerges when we discuss our relationships, how we are seen by others and see ourselves, and our social identities.

Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before.

(Being general is okay: Last night’s game and TV shows you like) What is one thing you hope to say? What is one question you will ask?</p>\n<p>Once this exercise becomes second nature—and it quickly will—you can make your preparation even more robust: What are two topics you most want to discuss? What is one thing you hope to say that shows what you want to talk about? What is one question you will ask that reveals what others want?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, we want others to go first. The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions, just as Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients. And open-ended questions are easy to find, if you focus on: Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”) Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”) Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”)</p>\n<p>Do your companions lean toward you, make eye contact, smile, backchannel (“Interesting,” “Hmm”), or interrupt? Those are signals they want to accept your invitation. (Interruptions, contrary to expectations, usually mean people want to add something.)</p>\n<p>Do they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own? People often misperceive these responses as listening. But they usually aren’t. (In fact, as the next few chapters explain, listening is much more active.) These are signals that someone is declining our invitation and wants to talk about something else—in which case, you need to keep searching—and experimenting—to learn what everyone wants.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-how-do-we-feel-conversation-an-overview\">THE HOW DO WE FEEL? CONVERSATION AN OVERVIEW</h2>\n<h3 id=\"the-listening-cure\">THE LISTENING CURE</h3>\n<p>instead of perspective taking, we ought to be focused on perspective getting, on asking people to describe their inner lives, their values and beliefs and feelings, the things they care about most.</p>\n<p>In fact, there was only one method the Arons tested that could reliably help strangers form a connection: A series of thirty-six questions that, as Elaine and Arthur Aron later wrote, elicited “sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.” These questions eventually became known as the Fast Friends Procedure, and grew famous among sociologists, psychologists, and readers of articles with headlines such as “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love.”[*1]</p>\n<p>To the Arons, the idea that vulnerability was important made perfect sense, in part because it lined up with a well-documented psychological phenomenon known as “<strong>emotional contagion</strong>.” In the early 1990s, a series of experiments had shown that humans typically “synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them.” This synchronization is sometimes deliberate, like when we choose to empathize with another person; more often it is automatic, happening outside of our consciousness, causing us to tear up or get angry or proud on someone else’s behalf, whether we want to or not.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>emotional contagion must be triggered by something, and one of the most reliable triggers is vulnerability. We become more prone to emotional contagion when we hear someone else express—or when we reveal our own—deeply held beliefs and values, or when we describe past experiences that were meaningful to us, or when we expose something else that opens us to others’ judgments. These are the same factors the Arons used to distinguish deep questions from shallow ones.</p>\n<p>we become more susceptible to emotional contagion, and more emotionally contagious ourselves, when we share something that feels raw, something that another person might judge.</p>\n<p>If you want to connect with someone, ask them what they are feeling, and then reveal your own emotions.</p>\n<p>They found that during successful conversations, people tended to ask each other the kinds of questions that drew out replies where people expressed their “needs, goals, beliefs [and] emotions,” as the researchers later wrote. In unsuccessful conversations, people talked mostly about themselves, or they asked shallow questions, the kinds of inquiries that didn’t reveal anything about how their partners felt.</p>\n<p>Questions about facts (“Where do you live?” “What college did you attend?”) are often conversational dead-ends. They don’t draw out values or experiences. They don’t invite vulnerability. However, those same inquiries, recast slightly (“What do you like about where you live?” “What was your favorite part of college?”), invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change. Those questions make emotional replies easier, and they practically beg the questioner to reciprocate—to divulge, in return, why they live in this neighborhood, what they enjoyed about college—until everyone is drawn in, asking and answering back and forth.</p>\n<p>What’s more, these kinds of deeper questions can help fight the unfair discrepancies in how men and women, as well as other groups, are allowed to express emotions. In part, these kinds of questions succeed because they allow vulnerable replies without mandating them. They don’t seem pushy or out of place within, say, an office. But they undermine double standards by nudging people to think a bit more about how to respond.</p>\n<p>This is how to ask emotional questions in the real world: Ask someone how they feel about something, and then follow up with questions that reveal how you feel.</p>\n<p>deep, vulnerable questions were easier to ask—and more enjoyable to answer—than most people realized.</p>\n<p>Science has provided guidance: Ask others about their beliefs and values. Ask them about experiences and those moments that caused them to change. Ask how they feel, rather than about facts. Reframe your questions so they are deeper. Ask follow-ups. And as people expose their vulnerabilities, reveal something about yourself. It will be less uncomfortable than you imagine. It will be more fascinating than you think. And it might lead to a moment of true connection.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-you-hear-emotions-no-one-says-aloud\">HOW DO YOU HEAR EMOTIONS NO ONE SAYS ALOUD?</h3>\n<p>Psychologists refer to this kind of communication as <strong>nonlinguistic emotional expressions</strong>, and they comprise a vast portion of how we convey our feelings in everyday life.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>We laugh, in other words, to show someone that we want to connect with them—and our companions laugh back to demonstrate they want to connect with us, as well. This is the same kind of reciprocity that powers the Fast Friends Procedure. It’s an example of emotional contagion.</p>\n<p>Laughter, and other nonlinguistic expressions such as gasps and sighs, or smiles and frowns, are embodiments of the <strong>matching principle</strong>, which says that we communicate by aligning our behaviors until our brains become entrained.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>When we laugh together, it’s not just the laughter that’s important. It’s similar intensities—the evidence of a desire to connect—that is critical.</p>\n<p>What matters isn’t speaking and acting alike, but rather matching one another in ways that convey the desire to align.</p>\n<p>In one study published in 2016, participants who listened to one-second recordings of people laughing could accurately distinguish between friends laughing together, and strangers trying to laugh alike. Laughter, like many nonlinguistic expressions, is useful because it’s hard to fake. When someone isn’t genuinely laughing, we can tell. The participants listening to the recordings in that study, based on just one second of decontextualized sound, could tell when people felt aligned and when they were likely forcing it. A joke might not be funny, but if we both agree to laugh in similar ways, we’re signaling to each other that we want to connect.</p>\n<p>Even if we genuinely want to know and match someone’s emotions, that’s hard to do, because we don’t know precisely what they are feeling. So, instead, our brains have evolved this quick-acting system to examine mood and energy, which provides a general sense, in a split second, of someone’s emotional state. That’s usually enough to figure out how to align, and whether we should feel safe or alarmed.</p>\n<p>We exhibit emotional intelligence by showing people that we’ve heard their emotions—and the way we do that is by noticing, and then matching, their mood and energy.</p>\n<p>What mattered most, though, was whether they paid attention to McGuire’s emotional displays and then matched his energy and mood. For some candidates, matching seemed like an instinct; for others, a learned skill. And for some, it didn’t happen at all.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to tell exactly what someone is feeling, to know if they are angry or upset or frustrated or annoyed or some combination of all those emotions. The person, themself, might not know. So instead of trying to decipher specific emotions, pay attention to someone’s mood (Do they seem negative or positive?) and their energy level (Are they high energy or low energy?). Then, focus on matching those two attributes—or, if matching will only exacerbate tensions, show that you hear their emotions by acknowledging how they feel. Make it obvious you are working to understand their emotions. And when you, yourself, are expressing your own emotions, notice how others are responding. Are they trying to align with your energy and mood?</p>\n<h3 id=\"connecting-amid-conflict\">CONNECTING AMID CONFLICT</h3>\n<p>Emotional intelligence comes from showing someone we have heard their emotions. But when we’re in a conflict or a fight, simply showing often isn’t enough. In those moments, everyone is skeptical and untrusting: Are they listening, or just preparing their rebuttal? Something more is needed, an extra step. To convince others we are genuinely listening during an argument, we must prove to them that we have heard them, prove we are working hard to understand, prove we want to see things from their perspective.</p>\n<p>most people don’t know how to prove they’re listening. They try things like making eye contact with the speaker, or nodding their head to show agreement, and hope the speaker will pay attention. But speakers usually don’t.</p>\n<p>When we’re speaking, we’re frequently so focused on what we are saying that we don’t pick up on how our listeners are behaving. We miss the signals that listeners are trying to send to show they are following along. So if a listener wants to prove they’re listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we’re paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said. And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.</p>\n<p>Among happy couples, however, the desire for control emerged quite differently. Rather than trying to control the other person, happy couples tended to focus, instead, on controlling themselves, their environment, and the conflict itself.</p>\n<p>Happy couples also focused on controlling their environment. Rather than starting a fight at the moment a conflict arose, they would put off a tough discussion until they were in a safer setting.</p>\n<p>Finally, happy couples seemed to concentrate more on controlling the boundaries of the conflict itself.</p>\n<p>unhappy couples let one area of disagreement spill into everything else. “They start arguing about, ‘Are we spending the holidays with my family or yours?’ and pretty soon it becomes, ‘You’re so selfish, you never do the laundry, this is why we don’t have enough money.’ ” (In marriage therapy, this is called <strong>kitchen-sinking</strong>, a particularly destructive pattern.)</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>One advantage of focusing on these three things—controlling oneself, the environment, and the boundaries of the conflict—is that it allowed happy spouses to find things they could control together. They were still fighting. They still disagreed. But, when it came to control, they were on the same side of the table.</p>\n<p>If we focus on controlling ourselves, our environment, and the conflict itself, then a fight often morphs into a conversation, where the goal is understanding, rather than winning points or wounding our foes.</p>\n<p>Trying to force someone to listen, or see our side, only inflames the battle. Instead, it is far better to harness our craving for control so that we’re working together, cooperating to find ways to lower the temperature and make this fight smaller.</p>\n<p>This explains why looping for understanding is so powerful: When you prove to someone you are listening, you are, in effect, giving them some control over the conversation. This is also why the matching principle is so effective: When we follow someone else’s lead and become emotional when they are emotional, or practical when they have signaled a practical mindset, we are sharing control over how a dialogue flows.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, when we try to exert control, we don’t realize we’re doing it. We think we’re simply stating our opinion, or offering advice, and don’t understand that others will perceive it as attempting to strong-arm a conversation’s direction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-guide-to-using-these-ideas-part-iii\">A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART III</h3>\n<p>There is a moment, in many conversations, when someone says something emotional, or we reveal our own feelings, or we want to understand why we keep fighting, or we hope to get closer to someone who feels distant. That is when a How Do We Feel? conversation might begin, if we allow it to. And one of the best ways to start is to ask a deep question. Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned.</p>\n<p>A deep question asks about someone’s values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts.</p>\n<p>A deep question asks people to talk about how they feel.</p>\n<p>Asking a deep question should feel like sharing.</p>\n<p>Once we ask a deep question, we need to listen closely to how others reply. Listening requires paying attention to more than just the words they say. To hear what a person is saying, we also need to pay attention to their nonlinguistic emotional expressions—the sounds they make, their gestures, tone of voice and cadence, how they hold their bodies and their expressions.</p>\n<p>it is critical to be attuned to two things:</p>\n<p>Mood: Do they seem upbeat or glum? How would you describe their expressions? Are they laughing, or shouting? Are they up or down?</p>\n<p>Energy: Are they high energy, or low energy? Quiet and withdrawn or talkative and expressive? If they seem happy, is it calm and content (low energy) or excited and outgoing (high energy)? If they are unhappy, are they sad (low energy) or agitated (high energy)?</p>\n<p>Mood and energy levels often tell us all we need to know in order to align emotionally. Sometimes, we might not want to match emotions: If someone is angry, and we become angry, it may drive us apart. But if we acknowledge their mood and energy—“You seem upset. What’s wrong?”—we can start to align.</p>\n<p>One of the most important aspects of emotional communication is showing others we hear their emotions, which helps us reciprocate. There’s a technique for this—looping for understanding. Here’s how it works: Ask questions, to make sure you understand what someone has said. Repeat back, in your own words, what you heard. Ask if you got it right. Continue until everyone agrees we understand.</p>\n<p>The goal of looping isn’t parroting someone’s words, but rather distilling another person’s thoughts in your own language, showing them that you are working hard to see their perspective, and then repeating the process until everyone is aligned.</p>\n<p>We reciprocate vulnerability by… Looping for understanding, until you understand what someone is feeling. Looking for what someone needs: Do they want comfort? Empathy? Advice? Tough love? (If you don’t know the answer, loop more.) Asking permission. “Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?” or “Would you mind if I shared something from my own life?” or “Can I share how I’ve seen others handle this?” Giving something in return. This can be as simple as describing how you feel: “It makes me sad to hear you’re in pain,” or “I’m so happy for you,” or “I’m proud to be your friend.”</p>\n<p>When we are in conflict with someone… First, acknowledge understanding. We do this through looping and statements such as “Let me make sure I understand.” &hellip; Second, find specific points of agreement. Look for places where you can say “I agree with you” or “I think you’re right that…” These remind everyone that, though we may have differences, we want to be aligned. Finally, temper your claims. Don’t make sweeping statements such as “Everyone knows that’s not true” or “Your side always gets this wrong.” Rather, use words like somewhat or “It might be…” and speak about specific experiences (“I want to talk about why you left dishes in the sink last night”) rather than broad generalities (“I want to talk about how you never do your part around the house”).</p>\n<p>One of the biggest problems with online discussions, of course, is they lack the information usually provided by our voices and bodies: Our vocal tones, gestures, expressions, and the cadence and energy we bring to our speech. Even when we write letters, we tend to include nuances and subtleties that come from editing ourselves and thinking about what we want to say.</p>\n<p>When talking online, remember to… Overemphasize politeness. Numerous studies have shown that online tensions are lessened if at least one person is consistently polite. In one study, all it took was adding thanks and please to a series of online arguments—while everything else stayed the same—to reduce tensions. &hellip; Underemphasize sarcasm. When we say something in a wry tone, it signals an irony our audience usually understands. When we type something sarcastic online, we typically hear these same inflections within our heads—but the people reading our comments do not. Express more gratitude, deference, greetings, apologies, and hedges. Studies demonstrate that when we are grateful (“That comment taught me a lot”), or solicitous (“I would love to hear your thoughts”), or preface comments with a greeting (“Hey!”), or apologize in advance (“I hope you don’t mind…”) or hedge our comments (“I think…”), online communication gets better. Avoid criticism in public forums. In another study, researchers found that giving negative feedback online backfires much more than in real life. It pushes people to write more negative things, and to start criticizing others more frequently. When we criticize others publicly online, we make bad behavior into a digital norm.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-who-are-we-conversation\">THE WHO ARE WE? CONVERSATION</h2>\n<h3 id=\"our-social-identities-shape-our-worlds\">OUR SOCIAL IDENTITIES SHAPE OUR WORLDS</h3>\n<p>“<strong>social identities</strong>”: The self-images we all form based on the groups we belong to, the people we befriend, the organizations we join, and the histories we embrace or shun.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>The meaningfulness of various identities—the importance of gender versus race versus politics versus who we support in the Super Bowl—becomes more and less salient based on our environment and what’s happening around us.</p>\n<p>Steele and his colleagues called this undermining effect <strong>stereotype threat</strong>, and since those first experiments in the late 1990s, hundreds of other studies have both confirmed its existence and examined its pernicious effect. Simply knowing that a stereotype exists can influence how we behave.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Put differently, when researchers changed the environment, it made stereotypes less salient and therefore less threatening. “You can do that in a classroom, which is good,” Steele told me. “But it’s hard to do that in society, where everyone knows these stereotypes exist.”</p>\n<p>It’s crucial, in a Who Are We? conversation, to remind ourselves that we all possess multiple identities:</p>\n<p>“When my son goes to school, I tell him, remember, that test may be hard today, but think about who else you are,” said Gresky, the researcher at Texas Christian University. “We can make the bad voices in our head less powerful by remembering all the other voices in there, too.”</p>\n<p>The process for drawing out those voices is relatively straightforward: In a Who Are We? conversation, invite people to talk about their backgrounds, allegiances, how their communities have shaped them. (“Where are you from? Oh, really? What was it like growing up there?”) Then, reciprocate by describing how you see yourself. (“You know, as a southerner, I think that…”) Finally, avoid the trap of one-dimensionality by evoking all the many identities we all possess as a conversation unfolds: “I hear you saying that, as a lawyer, you support the police, but as a parent, do you worry about cops pulling over your kid?”</p>\n<p>the <strong>contact hypothesis</strong>—the theory that, if you bring people with clashing social identities together under specific conditions, you can overcome old hatreds.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>These kinds of environmental shifts point to what is needed for a successful Who Are We? conversation: First, try to draw out your conversational partners’ multiple identities. It’s important to remind everyone that we all contain multitudes; none of us is one-dimensional. Acknowledging those complexities during a conversation helps disrupt the stereotypes within our heads. Second, try to ensure everyone is on equal footing. Don’t offer unsolicited advice or trumpet your wealth or connections. Seek out topics where everyone has some experience and knowledge, or everyone is a novice. Encourage the quiet to speak and the talkative to listen, so everyone is participating. Finally, look for social similarities that already exist. We do this naturally when we meet someone new and start searching for people we know in common. But it is important to take those connections a step further and make our commonalities more salient.</p>\n<p>the most effective approach was something known as <strong>motivational interviewing</strong>, a method originally developed in the 1980s to help problem drinkers. In motivational interviewing, a 2012 paper explains, “counselors rarely attempt to convince or persuade. Instead, the counselor subtly guides the client to think about and verbally express their own reasons for and against change.” Motivational interviewing seeks to draw out a person’s beliefs, values, and social identities, in the hopes that, once all these complexities and complicated beliefs are on the table, unexpected opportunities for change might appear.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-do-we-make-the-hardest-conversations-safer\">HOW DO WE MAKE THE HARDEST CONVERSATIONS SAFER?</h3>\n<p>the listener, offended, would become defensive as their sense of self—their identity—was attacked. In psychology, this is known as <strong>identity threat</strong>, and it is deeply corrosive to communication.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> .d</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>The mere possibility of identity threat frequently stops people from talking about Who Are We?</p>\n<p>There are lessons here for tough conversations of all types, even beyond those related to our identities. The first insight is that, as we’ve seen before, preparing for a conversation before it begins—thinking just a little bit more when we open our mouths—can have enormous impacts. Anticipating obstacles, planning for what to do when they arise, considering what you hope to say, thinking about what might be important to others: Before any challenging conversation, think for a few moments about what you hope will happen, what might go wrong, and how you’ll react when it does. The second lesson is that just because we’re worried about a conversation, that doesn’t mean we ought to avoid it. When we need to deliver disappointing news to a friend, complain to a boss, or discuss something unpleasant with our partner, it’s normal to feel a sense of hesitation. But we can reduce that tension by reminding ourselves why this conversation is important and diminish our anxieties by acknowledging, to ourselves and others, that these conversations may be awkward at first, but will get easier. Third, thinking about how a conversation will occur is just as important as what is said, particularly during a Who Are We? conversation. Who will speak first? (Studies suggest the person with the least power should begin.) What kinds of emotions should we anticipate? (If we prepare for discomfort and tension, we make them easier to withstand.) What obstacles should we expect? When they emerge, what will we do? Most important, what benefits do we expect will emerge from this dialogue, and are they worth the risks?</p>\n<p>Establish guidelines and make sure they are clearly communicated. Invite everyone into the dialogue and give everyone a voice—and let everyone know they are expected to examine themselves. Focus on belonging, and creating a sense that everyone is welcome.</p>\n<p>as Kiara Sanchez put it, the aim is not to “neutralize the discomfort, but rather give people a framework for persevering through it. It seems like a minor distinction, but the underlying theory is that discomfort can be helpful.” Discomfort pushes us to think before we speak, to try to understand how others see or hear things differently. Discomfort reminds us to keep going, that the goal is worth the challenge.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that, alongside encouraging such questions, guidelines must also allow people to decline to answer. This is critical because, historically, individuals from marginalized communities have been asked to do an outsized amount of work describing their lives.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-guide-to-using-these-ideas-part-iv\">A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART IV</h3>\n<p>consider our actions during three distinct periods: before a discussion, at the beginning of the discussion, and as the discussion unfolds.</p>\n<p>Ask yourself: What do you hope to accomplish? &hellip; How will this conversation start? &hellip; What obstacles might emerge? &hellip; When those obstacles appear, what’s the plan? &hellip; Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue?</p>\n<p>As a conversation begins: First, establish guidelines. &hellip; Second, draw out everyone’s goals. &hellip; Finally, acknowledge, and keep acknowledging, that discomfort is natural—and useful.</p>\n<p>Once we’ve prepared for a hard conversation, and have discussed guidelines and goals, we should remember to: Draw out multiple identities. &hellip; Work to ensure everyone is on an equal footing. &hellip; Acknowledge people’s experiences and look for genuine similarities. &hellip; Manage your environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"afterword\">AFTERWORD</h2>\n<p>They discovered some correlations: Having loving parents made it easier to find happiness as an adult. Possessing genes related to physical hardiness and longevity was helpful—as was getting enough exercise and eating well. Education early in life, as well as a lifelong commitment to learning, also provided a leg up. However, as important as these factors were, one thing seemed to matter much more than anything else. It didn’t come as a surprise; it had been obvious to everyone, across the decades, as they had conducted their interviews. The most important variable in determining whether someone ended up happy and healthy, or miserable and sick, was “how satisfied they were in their relationships,” one researcher wrote. “The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest (mentally and physically) at age 80.”</p>\n<p>Across the decades and surveys, similar findings emerged again and again: The happiest participants called others regularly, made lunch and dinner dates, sent notes to friends saying they were proud of them, or wanted to help them shoulder sad news. Most of all, happy participants engaged in many, many conversations over the years that brought them closer to others.</p>\n<p>This central finding has been replicated in hundreds of other studies over the past few decades. “We now have robust evidence indicating that being socially connected has a powerful influence on longevity, such that having more and better relationships is associated with protection and, conversely, that having fewer and poorer relationships is associated with risk,”</p>\n<p>It has helped me to connect better, to be more mindful when other people reveal something personal, to know that there is always a conversation going on—be it practical, emotional, or social—and that we won’t be able to connect until we come to an understanding about what we all want and need. Most of all, it has convinced me of the importance of having learning conversations, where my aim is to pay attention to what kind of conversation is occurring; to identify our goals for a dialogue; to ask about others’ emotions and share my own feelings; and to explore if our identities influence what we say and hear.</p>\n<p>There is no single right way to connect with other people. There are skills that make conversations easier and less awkward. There are tips that increase the odds you’ll understand your companions, and they’ll be more likely to hear what you are trying to say. The effectiveness of various conversational tactics waxes and wanes based on our surroundings, the types of discussion we’re having, the kind of relationships we hope to achieve. Sometimes we get there; sometimes we don’t. But what’s important is wanting to connect, wanting to understand someone, wanting to have a deep conversation, even when it is hard and scary, or when it would be so much easier to walk away. There are skills and insights that can help us satisfy that desire for connection, and they are worth learning, practicing, and committing to. Because whether we call it love, or friendship, or simply having a great conversation, achieving connection—authentic, meaningful connection—is the most important thing in life.</p>",
				"content_text": "Read: _[Supercommunicators](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/)_ by Charles Duhigg\n\n**Recommended**, with a caveat:\n\nIt's not exactly what the title implies it will be, nor is it the same book at the end as it is at the start. In fact, the supposed mission of the book is truly only covered in an almost-footnote in the afterword (my final highlight captured at the bottom of this post). Nevertheless, it was full of useful information presented in useful ways. \n\n# My Reading Highlights and Notes\n\n<!--more-->\n\n# Supercommunicators by Charles Duhigg\n\n## PROLOGUE\n\n\nWhen we “click” with someone, our eyes often start to dilate in tandem; our pulses match; we feel the same emotions and start to complete each other’s sentences within our heads. This is known as __neural entrainment__, and it feels wonderful.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBut scientists have now unraveled many of the secrets of how successful conversations happen. They’ve learned that paying attention to someone’s body, alongside their voice, helps us hear them better. They have determined that how we ask a question sometimes matters more than what we ask. We’re better off, it seems, acknowledging social differences, rather than pretending they don’t exist. Every discussion is influenced by emotions, no matter how rational the topic at hand. When starting a dialogue, it helps to think of the discussion as a negotiation where the prize is figuring out what everyone wants. And, above all, the most important goal of any conversation is to connect.\n\n\nThe first one is that many discussions are actually three different conversations. There are practical, decision-making conversations that focus on What’s This Really About? There are emotional conversations, which ask How Do We Feel? And there are social conversations that explore Who Are We? We are often moving in and out of all three conversations as a dialogue unfolds. However, if we aren’t having the same kind of conversation as our partners, at the same moment, we’re unlikely to connect with each other.\n\n\nOur goal, for the most meaningful discussions, should be to have a “learning conversation.” Specifically, we want to learn how the people around us see the world and help them understand our perspectives in turn.\n\n\n## THE THREE KINDS OF CONVERSATION\n\n\n### THE MATCHING PRINCIPLE\n\n\nSome people consistently fail to synchronize with others, even when they’re speaking to close friends. Others—let’s call them __supercommunicators__—seem to synchronize effortlessly with just about anyone. Most of us lie somewhere in between.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nSometimes this connection occurs with just one other person. Other times, it happens within a group, or a large audience. But whenever it happens, our brains and bodies become alike because we are, in the language of neuroscientists, __neurally entrained__.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nScientists like Sievers don’t call these people supercommunicators—they prefer terms like high centrality participant or core information provider—but\n\n\nThese people tended to speak less than dominant leaders, and when they did open their mouths, it was usually to ask questions. They repeated others’ ideas and were quick to admit their own confusion or make fun of themselves. They encouraged their groupmates (“That’s really smart! Tell me more about what you think!”) and laughed at others’ jokes. They didn’t stand out as particularly talkative or clever, but when they spoke, everyone listened closely. And, somehow, they made it easier for other people to speak up. They made conversations flow. Sievers began referring to these people as __high centrality participants__.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBut the most important difference between high centrality participants and everyone else was that the high centrality participants were constantly adjusting how they communicated, in order to match their companions.\n\n\nto become a supercommunicator, all we need to do is listen closely to what’s said and unsaid, ask the right questions, recognize and match others’ moods, and make our own feelings easy for others to perceive.\n\n\nThe first mindset—the __decision-making mindset__—is associated with the What’s This Really About? conversation, and it’s active whenever we’re thinking about practical matters, such as making choices or analyzing plans.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThe second mindset—the __emotional mindset__—emerges when we discuss How Do We Feel? and draws on neural structures—the nucleus accumbens, the amygdala, and the hippocampus, among others—that help shape our beliefs, emotions, and memories.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThe third conversational mindset—the __social mindset__—emerges when we discuss our relationships, how we are seen by others and see ourselves, and our social identities. These are Who Are We? discussions.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nEach of these conversations—and each mindset—is, of course, deeply intertwined. We often use all three during a single dialogue. The important thing to understand is that these mindsets can shift as a conversation unfolds.\n\n\nMiscommunication occurs when people are having different kinds of conversations. If you are speaking emotionally, while I’m talking practically, we are, in essence, using different cognitive languages.\n\n\nThe importance of this insight—that communication comes from connection and alignment—is so fundamental that it has become known as the __matching principle__: Effective communication requires recognizing what kind of conversation is occurring, and then matching each other.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n### A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART I\n\n\n## THE WHAT’S THIS REALLY ABOUT? CONVERSATION AN OVERVIEW\n\n\n### EVERY CONVERSATION IS A NEGOTIATION\n\n\nSome researchers call this process a __quiet negotiation__: A subtle give-and-take over which topics we’ll dive into and which we’ll skirt around; the rules for how we’ll speak and listen.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n“When it happens again and again, you start to realize: This isn’t a problem with my patients,” Ehdaie told me. “This is a problem with me. I’m doing something wrong. I’m failing at this conversation.”\n\n\nThe simplest method for uncovering everyone’s desires, of course, is simply asking What do you want? But that approach can fail if people don’t know, or are embarrassed to say, or aren’t certain how to express their desires, or worry that revealing too much will put them at a disadvantage.\n\n\n“It’s important to ask what they want,” Ehdaie told me. “It’s an invitation for people to tell you who they are.”\n\n\nFisher and his colleagues wrote, might seem impossible, but “it is increasingly recognized that there are cooperative ways of negotiating our differences and that even if a ‘win-win’ solution cannot be found, a wise agreement can still often be reached that is better for both sides.” Since Getting to Yes was first published, hundreds of studies have found ample evidence to support this idea. Elite diplomats have explained that their goal at a bargaining table isn’t seizing victory, but rather convincing the other side to become collaborators in uncovering new solutions that no one thought of before. Negotiation, among its top practitioners, isn’t a battle. It’s an act of creativity. This approach has become known as __interest-based bargaining__,\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nHow will we make decisions together? What are the rules for this dialogue? Frequently, the best way to figure out those rules is by testing out various conversational approaches, and seeing how others react.\n\n\nWhen we make a joke, or ask a probing question, or suddenly get serious or silly, we are, in a sense, conducting a test to see if our companions will accept our invitation, if they’ll play along.\n\n\nThese discussions call for analysis and clearheaded reasoning. Psychologists refer to this kind of thinking as __the logic of costs and benefits__. When people embrace logical reasoning and practical calculations—when they agree that rational decision making is the most persuasive method for making a choice together—they’re agreeing to contrast potential costs with hoped-for benefits.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nIn general, in these kinds of discussions, we make decisions not by analyzing costs and benefits, but instead by looking to our past experiences and asking ourselves, “What does someone like me usually do in a situation like this?” We are applying what psychologists call __the logic of similarities__.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nmatching is understanding someone’s mindset—what kind of logic they find persuasive, what tone and approach makes sense to them—and then speaking their language.\n\n\n### A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART II\n\n\nWhen someone makes noises as they listen (“Yeah,” “Uh-huh,” “Interesting”), it’s a sign they’re engaged, what linguists call __backchanneling__.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nin the moments before a conversation starts, it’s useful to describe for yourself: What are two topics you might discuss? (Being general is okay: Last night’s game and TV shows you like) What is one thing you hope to say? What is one question you will ask?\n\n\nOnce this exercise becomes second nature—and it quickly will—you can make your preparation even more robust: What are two topics you most want to discuss? What is one thing you hope to say that shows what you want to talk about? What is one question you will ask that reveals what others want?\n\n\nSometimes, we want others to go first. The easiest way to do that is by asking open-ended questions, just as Dr. Ehdaie did with his patients. And open-ended questions are easy to find, if you focus on: Asking about someone’s beliefs or values (“How’d you decide to become a teacher?”) Asking someone to make a judgment (“Are you glad you went to law school?”) Asking about someone’s experiences (“What was it like to visit Europe?”)\n\n\nDo your companions lean toward you, make eye contact, smile, backchannel (“Interesting,” “Hmm”), or interrupt? Those are signals they want to accept your invitation. (Interruptions, contrary to expectations, usually mean people want to add something.)\n\n\nDo they become quiet, their expressions passive, their eyes fixed somewhere besides your face? Do they seem overly contemplative? Do they take in your comments without adding thoughts of their own? People often misperceive these responses as listening. But they usually aren’t. (In fact, as the next few chapters explain, listening is much more active.) These are signals that someone is declining our invitation and wants to talk about something else—in which case, you need to keep searching—and experimenting—to learn what everyone wants.\n\n\n## THE HOW DO WE FEEL? CONVERSATION AN OVERVIEW\n\n\n### THE LISTENING CURE\n\n\ninstead of perspective taking, we ought to be focused on perspective getting, on asking people to describe their inner lives, their values and beliefs and feelings, the things they care about most.\n\n\nIn fact, there was only one method the Arons tested that could reliably help strangers form a connection: A series of thirty-six questions that, as Elaine and Arthur Aron later wrote, elicited “sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personalistic self-disclosure.” These questions eventually became known as the Fast Friends Procedure, and grew famous among sociologists, psychologists, and readers of articles with headlines such as “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love.”[*1]\n\n\nTo the Arons, the idea that vulnerability was important made perfect sense, in part because it lined up with a well-documented psychological phenomenon known as “__emotional contagion__.” In the early 1990s, a series of experiments had shown that humans typically “synchronize their own emotions with the emotions expressed by those around them.” This synchronization is sometimes deliberate, like when we choose to empathize with another person; more often it is automatic, happening outside of our consciousness, causing us to tear up or get angry or proud on someone else’s behalf, whether we want to or not.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nemotional contagion must be triggered by something, and one of the most reliable triggers is vulnerability. We become more prone to emotional contagion when we hear someone else express—or when we reveal our own—deeply held beliefs and values, or when we describe past experiences that were meaningful to us, or when we expose something else that opens us to others’ judgments. These are the same factors the Arons used to distinguish deep questions from shallow ones.\n\n\nwe become more susceptible to emotional contagion, and more emotionally contagious ourselves, when we share something that feels raw, something that another person might judge.\n\n\nIf you want to connect with someone, ask them what they are feeling, and then reveal your own emotions.\n\n\nThey found that during successful conversations, people tended to ask each other the kinds of questions that drew out replies where people expressed their “needs, goals, beliefs [and] emotions,” as the researchers later wrote. In unsuccessful conversations, people talked mostly about themselves, or they asked shallow questions, the kinds of inquiries that didn’t reveal anything about how their partners felt.\n\n\nQuestions about facts (“Where do you live?” “What college did you attend?”) are often conversational dead-ends. They don’t draw out values or experiences. They don’t invite vulnerability. However, those same inquiries, recast slightly (“What do you like about where you live?” “What was your favorite part of college?”), invite others to share their preferences, beliefs, and values, and to describe experiences that caused them to grow or change. Those questions make emotional replies easier, and they practically beg the questioner to reciprocate—to divulge, in return, why they live in this neighborhood, what they enjoyed about college—until everyone is drawn in, asking and answering back and forth.\n\n\nWhat’s more, these kinds of deeper questions can help fight the unfair discrepancies in how men and women, as well as other groups, are allowed to express emotions. In part, these kinds of questions succeed because they allow vulnerable replies without mandating them. They don’t seem pushy or out of place within, say, an office. But they undermine double standards by nudging people to think a bit more about how to respond.\n\n\nThis is how to ask emotional questions in the real world: Ask someone how they feel about something, and then follow up with questions that reveal how you feel.\n\n\ndeep, vulnerable questions were easier to ask—and more enjoyable to answer—than most people realized.\n\n\nScience has provided guidance: Ask others about their beliefs and values. Ask them about experiences and those moments that caused them to change. Ask how they feel, rather than about facts. Reframe your questions so they are deeper. Ask follow-ups. And as people expose their vulnerabilities, reveal something about yourself. It will be less uncomfortable than you imagine. It will be more fascinating than you think. And it might lead to a moment of true connection.\n\n\n### HOW DO YOU HEAR EMOTIONS NO ONE SAYS ALOUD?\n\n\nPsychologists refer to this kind of communication as __nonlinguistic emotional expressions__, and they comprise a vast portion of how we convey our feelings in everyday life.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nWe laugh, in other words, to show someone that we want to connect with them—and our companions laugh back to demonstrate they want to connect with us, as well. This is the same kind of reciprocity that powers the Fast Friends Procedure. It’s an example of emotional contagion.\n\n\nLaughter, and other nonlinguistic expressions such as gasps and sighs, or smiles and frowns, are embodiments of the __matching principle__, which says that we communicate by aligning our behaviors until our brains become entrained.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nWhen we laugh together, it’s not just the laughter that’s important. It’s similar intensities—the evidence of a desire to connect—that is critical.\n\n\nWhat matters isn’t speaking and acting alike, but rather matching one another in ways that convey the desire to align.\n\n\nIn one study published in 2016, participants who listened to one-second recordings of people laughing could accurately distinguish between friends laughing together, and strangers trying to laugh alike. Laughter, like many nonlinguistic expressions, is useful because it’s hard to fake. When someone isn’t genuinely laughing, we can tell. The participants listening to the recordings in that study, based on just one second of decontextualized sound, could tell when people felt aligned and when they were likely forcing it. A joke might not be funny, but if we both agree to laugh in similar ways, we’re signaling to each other that we want to connect.\n\n\nEven if we genuinely want to know and match someone’s emotions, that’s hard to do, because we don’t know precisely what they are feeling. So, instead, our brains have evolved this quick-acting system to examine mood and energy, which provides a general sense, in a split second, of someone’s emotional state. That’s usually enough to figure out how to align, and whether we should feel safe or alarmed.\n\n\nWe exhibit emotional intelligence by showing people that we’ve heard their emotions—and the way we do that is by noticing, and then matching, their mood and energy.\n\n\nWhat mattered most, though, was whether they paid attention to McGuire’s emotional displays and then matched his energy and mood. For some candidates, matching seemed like an instinct; for others, a learned skill. And for some, it didn’t happen at all.\n\n\nIt’s hard to tell exactly what someone is feeling, to know if they are angry or upset or frustrated or annoyed or some combination of all those emotions. The person, themself, might not know. So instead of trying to decipher specific emotions, pay attention to someone’s mood (Do they seem negative or positive?) and their energy level (Are they high energy or low energy?). Then, focus on matching those two attributes—or, if matching will only exacerbate tensions, show that you hear their emotions by acknowledging how they feel. Make it obvious you are working to understand their emotions. And when you, yourself, are expressing your own emotions, notice how others are responding. Are they trying to align with your energy and mood?\n\n\n### CONNECTING AMID CONFLICT\n\n\nEmotional intelligence comes from showing someone we have heard their emotions. But when we’re in a conflict or a fight, simply showing often isn’t enough. In those moments, everyone is skeptical and untrusting: Are they listening, or just preparing their rebuttal? Something more is needed, an extra step. To convince others we are genuinely listening during an argument, we must prove to them that we have heard them, prove we are working hard to understand, prove we want to see things from their perspective.\n\n\nmost people don’t know how to prove they’re listening. They try things like making eye contact with the speaker, or nodding their head to show agreement, and hope the speaker will pay attention. But speakers usually don’t.\n\n\nWhen we’re speaking, we’re frequently so focused on what we are saying that we don’t pick up on how our listeners are behaving. We miss the signals that listeners are trying to send to show they are following along. So if a listener wants to prove they’re listening, they need to demonstrate it after the speaker finishes talking. If we want to show someone we’re paying attention, we need to prove, once that person has stopped speaking, that we have absorbed what they said. And the best way to do that is by repeating, in our own words, what we just heard them say—and then asking if we got it right.\n\n\nAmong happy couples, however, the desire for control emerged quite differently. Rather than trying to control the other person, happy couples tended to focus, instead, on controlling themselves, their environment, and the conflict itself.\n\n\nHappy couples also focused on controlling their environment. Rather than starting a fight at the moment a conflict arose, they would put off a tough discussion until they were in a safer setting.\n\n\nFinally, happy couples seemed to concentrate more on controlling the boundaries of the conflict itself.\n\n\nunhappy couples let one area of disagreement spill into everything else. “They start arguing about, ‘Are we spending the holidays with my family or yours?’ and pretty soon it becomes, ‘You’re so selfish, you never do the laundry, this is why we don’t have enough money.’ ” (In marriage therapy, this is called __kitchen-sinking__, a particularly destructive pattern.)\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nOne advantage of focusing on these three things—controlling oneself, the environment, and the boundaries of the conflict—is that it allowed happy spouses to find things they could control together. They were still fighting. They still disagreed. But, when it came to control, they were on the same side of the table.\n\n\nIf we focus on controlling ourselves, our environment, and the conflict itself, then a fight often morphs into a conversation, where the goal is understanding, rather than winning points or wounding our foes.\n\n\nTrying to force someone to listen, or see our side, only inflames the battle. Instead, it is far better to harness our craving for control so that we’re working together, cooperating to find ways to lower the temperature and make this fight smaller.\n\n\nThis explains why looping for understanding is so powerful: When you prove to someone you are listening, you are, in effect, giving them some control over the conversation. This is also why the matching principle is so effective: When we follow someone else’s lead and become emotional when they are emotional, or practical when they have signaled a practical mindset, we are sharing control over how a dialogue flows.\n\n\nSometimes, when we try to exert control, we don’t realize we’re doing it. We think we’re simply stating our opinion, or offering advice, and don’t understand that others will perceive it as attempting to strong-arm a conversation’s direction.\n\n\n### A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART III\n\n\nThere is a moment, in many conversations, when someone says something emotional, or we reveal our own feelings, or we want to understand why we keep fighting, or we hope to get closer to someone who feels distant. That is when a How Do We Feel? conversation might begin, if we allow it to. And one of the best ways to start is to ask a deep question. Deep questions are particularly good at creating intimacy because they ask people to describe their beliefs, values, feelings, and experiences in ways that can reveal something vulnerable. And vulnerability sparks emotional contagion, which makes us more aligned.\n\n\nA deep question asks about someone’s values, beliefs, judgments, or experiences—rather than just facts.\n\n\nA deep question asks people to talk about how they feel.\n\n\nAsking a deep question should feel like sharing.\n\n\nOnce we ask a deep question, we need to listen closely to how others reply. Listening requires paying attention to more than just the words they say. To hear what a person is saying, we also need to pay attention to their nonlinguistic emotional expressions—the sounds they make, their gestures, tone of voice and cadence, how they hold their bodies and their expressions.\n\n\nit is critical to be attuned to two things:\n\nMood: Do they seem upbeat or glum? How would you describe their expressions? Are they laughing, or shouting? Are they up or down?\n\nEnergy: Are they high energy, or low energy? Quiet and withdrawn or talkative and expressive? If they seem happy, is it calm and content (low energy) or excited and outgoing (high energy)? If they are unhappy, are they sad (low energy) or agitated (high energy)?\n\n\nMood and energy levels often tell us all we need to know in order to align emotionally. Sometimes, we might not want to match emotions: If someone is angry, and we become angry, it may drive us apart. But if we acknowledge their mood and energy—“You seem upset. What’s wrong?”—we can start to align.\n\n\nOne of the most important aspects of emotional communication is showing others we hear their emotions, which helps us reciprocate. There’s a technique for this—looping for understanding. Here’s how it works: Ask questions, to make sure you understand what someone has said. Repeat back, in your own words, what you heard. Ask if you got it right. Continue until everyone agrees we understand.\n\n\nThe goal of looping isn’t parroting someone’s words, but rather distilling another person’s thoughts in your own language, showing them that you are working hard to see their perspective, and then repeating the process until everyone is aligned.\n\n\nWe reciprocate vulnerability by… Looping for understanding, until you understand what someone is feeling. Looking for what someone needs: Do they want comfort? Empathy? Advice? Tough love? (If you don’t know the answer, loop more.) Asking permission. “Would it be okay if I told you how your words affect me?” or “Would you mind if I shared something from my own life?” or “Can I share how I’ve seen others handle this?” Giving something in return. This can be as simple as describing how you feel: “It makes me sad to hear you’re in pain,” or “I’m so happy for you,” or “I’m proud to be your friend.”\n\n\nWhen we are in conflict with someone… First, acknowledge understanding. We do this through looping and statements such as “Let me make sure I understand.” ... Second, find specific points of agreement. Look for places where you can say “I agree with you” or “I think you’re right that…” These remind everyone that, though we may have differences, we want to be aligned. Finally, temper your claims. Don’t make sweeping statements such as “Everyone knows that’s not true” or “Your side always gets this wrong.” Rather, use words like somewhat or “It might be…” and speak about specific experiences (“I want to talk about why you left dishes in the sink last night”) rather than broad generalities (“I want to talk about how you never do your part around the house”).\n\n\nOne of the biggest problems with online discussions, of course, is they lack the information usually provided by our voices and bodies: Our vocal tones, gestures, expressions, and the cadence and energy we bring to our speech. Even when we write letters, we tend to include nuances and subtleties that come from editing ourselves and thinking about what we want to say.\n\n\nWhen talking online, remember to… Overemphasize politeness. Numerous studies have shown that online tensions are lessened if at least one person is consistently polite. In one study, all it took was adding thanks and please to a series of online arguments—while everything else stayed the same—to reduce tensions. ... Underemphasize sarcasm. When we say something in a wry tone, it signals an irony our audience usually understands. When we type something sarcastic online, we typically hear these same inflections within our heads—but the people reading our comments do not. Express more gratitude, deference, greetings, apologies, and hedges. Studies demonstrate that when we are grateful (“That comment taught me a lot”), or solicitous (“I would love to hear your thoughts”), or preface comments with a greeting (“Hey!”), or apologize in advance (“I hope you don’t mind…”) or hedge our comments (“I think…”), online communication gets better. Avoid criticism in public forums. In another study, researchers found that giving negative feedback online backfires much more than in real life. It pushes people to write more negative things, and to start criticizing others more frequently. When we criticize others publicly online, we make bad behavior into a digital norm.\n\n\n## THE WHO ARE WE? CONVERSATION\n\n\n### OUR SOCIAL IDENTITIES SHAPE OUR WORLDS\n\n\n“__social identities__”: The self-images we all form based on the groups we belong to, the people we befriend, the organizations we join, and the histories we embrace or shun.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThe meaningfulness of various identities—the importance of gender versus race versus politics versus who we support in the Super Bowl—becomes more and less salient based on our environment and what’s happening around us.\n\n\nSteele and his colleagues called this undermining effect __stereotype threat__, and since those first experiments in the late 1990s, hundreds of other studies have both confirmed its existence and examined its pernicious effect. Simply knowing that a stereotype exists can influence how we behave.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nPut differently, when researchers changed the environment, it made stereotypes less salient and therefore less threatening. “You can do that in a classroom, which is good,” Steele told me. “But it’s hard to do that in society, where everyone knows these stereotypes exist.”\n\n\nIt’s crucial, in a Who Are We? conversation, to remind ourselves that we all possess multiple identities:\n\n\n“When my son goes to school, I tell him, remember, that test may be hard today, but think about who else you are,” said Gresky, the researcher at Texas Christian University. “We can make the bad voices in our head less powerful by remembering all the other voices in there, too.”\n\n\nThe process for drawing out those voices is relatively straightforward: In a Who Are We? conversation, invite people to talk about their backgrounds, allegiances, how their communities have shaped them. (“Where are you from? Oh, really? What was it like growing up there?”) Then, reciprocate by describing how you see yourself. (“You know, as a southerner, I think that…”) Finally, avoid the trap of one-dimensionality by evoking all the many identities we all possess as a conversation unfolds: “I hear you saying that, as a lawyer, you support the police, but as a parent, do you worry about cops pulling over your kid?”\n\n\nthe __contact hypothesis__—the theory that, if you bring people with clashing social identities together under specific conditions, you can overcome old hatreds.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThese kinds of environmental shifts point to what is needed for a successful Who Are We? conversation: First, try to draw out your conversational partners’ multiple identities. It’s important to remind everyone that we all contain multitudes; none of us is one-dimensional. Acknowledging those complexities during a conversation helps disrupt the stereotypes within our heads. Second, try to ensure everyone is on equal footing. Don’t offer unsolicited advice or trumpet your wealth or connections. Seek out topics where everyone has some experience and knowledge, or everyone is a novice. Encourage the quiet to speak and the talkative to listen, so everyone is participating. Finally, look for social similarities that already exist. We do this naturally when we meet someone new and start searching for people we know in common. But it is important to take those connections a step further and make our commonalities more salient.\n\n\nthe most effective approach was something known as __motivational interviewing__, a method originally developed in the 1980s to help problem drinkers. In motivational interviewing, a 2012 paper explains, “counselors rarely attempt to convince or persuade. Instead, the counselor subtly guides the client to think about and verbally express their own reasons for and against change.” Motivational interviewing seeks to draw out a person’s beliefs, values, and social identities, in the hopes that, once all these complexities and complicated beliefs are on the table, unexpected opportunities for change might appear.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n### HOW DO WE MAKE THE HARDEST CONVERSATIONS SAFER?\n\n\nthe listener, offended, would become defensive as their sense of self—their identity—was attacked. In psychology, this is known as __identity threat__, and it is deeply corrosive to communication.\n\n**Note:** .d\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThe mere possibility of identity threat frequently stops people from talking about Who Are We?\n\n\nThere are lessons here for tough conversations of all types, even beyond those related to our identities. The first insight is that, as we’ve seen before, preparing for a conversation before it begins—thinking just a little bit more when we open our mouths—can have enormous impacts. Anticipating obstacles, planning for what to do when they arise, considering what you hope to say, thinking about what might be important to others: Before any challenging conversation, think for a few moments about what you hope will happen, what might go wrong, and how you’ll react when it does. The second lesson is that just because we’re worried about a conversation, that doesn’t mean we ought to avoid it. When we need to deliver disappointing news to a friend, complain to a boss, or discuss something unpleasant with our partner, it’s normal to feel a sense of hesitation. But we can reduce that tension by reminding ourselves why this conversation is important and diminish our anxieties by acknowledging, to ourselves and others, that these conversations may be awkward at first, but will get easier. Third, thinking about how a conversation will occur is just as important as what is said, particularly during a Who Are We? conversation. Who will speak first? (Studies suggest the person with the least power should begin.) What kinds of emotions should we anticipate? (If we prepare for discomfort and tension, we make them easier to withstand.) What obstacles should we expect? When they emerge, what will we do? Most important, what benefits do we expect will emerge from this dialogue, and are they worth the risks?\n\n\nEstablish guidelines and make sure they are clearly communicated. Invite everyone into the dialogue and give everyone a voice—and let everyone know they are expected to examine themselves. Focus on belonging, and creating a sense that everyone is welcome.\n\n\nas Kiara Sanchez put it, the aim is not to “neutralize the discomfort, but rather give people a framework for persevering through it. It seems like a minor distinction, but the underlying theory is that discomfort can be helpful.” Discomfort pushes us to think before we speak, to try to understand how others see or hear things differently. Discomfort reminds us to keep going, that the goal is worth the challenge.\n\n\nIt is important to note that, alongside encouraging such questions, guidelines must also allow people to decline to answer. This is critical because, historically, individuals from marginalized communities have been asked to do an outsized amount of work describing their lives.\n\n\n### A GUIDE TO USING THESE IDEAS PART IV\n\n\nconsider our actions during three distinct periods: before a discussion, at the beginning of the discussion, and as the discussion unfolds.\n\n\nAsk yourself: What do you hope to accomplish? ... How will this conversation start? ... What obstacles might emerge? ... When those obstacles appear, what’s the plan? ... Finally, what are the benefits of this dialogue?\n\n\nAs a conversation begins: First, establish guidelines. ... Second, draw out everyone’s goals. ... Finally, acknowledge, and keep acknowledging, that discomfort is natural—and useful.\n\n\nOnce we’ve prepared for a hard conversation, and have discussed guidelines and goals, we should remember to: Draw out multiple identities. ... Work to ensure everyone is on an equal footing. ... Acknowledge people’s experiences and look for genuine similarities. ... Manage your environment.\n\n\n## AFTERWORD\n\n\nThey discovered some correlations: Having loving parents made it easier to find happiness as an adult. Possessing genes related to physical hardiness and longevity was helpful—as was getting enough exercise and eating well. Education early in life, as well as a lifelong commitment to learning, also provided a leg up. However, as important as these factors were, one thing seemed to matter much more than anything else. It didn’t come as a surprise; it had been obvious to everyone, across the decades, as they had conducted their interviews. The most important variable in determining whether someone ended up happy and healthy, or miserable and sick, was “how satisfied they were in their relationships,” one researcher wrote. “The people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest (mentally and physically) at age 80.”\n\n\nAcross the decades and surveys, similar findings emerged again and again: The happiest participants called others regularly, made lunch and dinner dates, sent notes to friends saying they were proud of them, or wanted to help them shoulder sad news. Most of all, happy participants engaged in many, many conversations over the years that brought them closer to others.\n\n\nThis central finding has been replicated in hundreds of other studies over the past few decades. “We now have robust evidence indicating that being socially connected has a powerful influence on longevity, such that having more and better relationships is associated with protection and, conversely, that having fewer and poorer relationships is associated with risk,”\n\n\nIt has helped me to connect better, to be more mindful when other people reveal something personal, to know that there is always a conversation going on—be it practical, emotional, or social—and that we won’t be able to connect until we come to an understanding about what we all want and need. Most of all, it has convinced me of the importance of having learning conversations, where my aim is to pay attention to what kind of conversation is occurring; to identify our goals for a dialogue; to ask about others’ emotions and share my own feelings; and to explore if our identities influence what we say and hear.\n\n\nThere is no single right way to connect with other people. There are skills that make conversations easier and less awkward. There are tips that increase the odds you’ll understand your companions, and they’ll be more likely to hear what you are trying to say. The effectiveness of various conversational tactics waxes and wanes based on our surroundings, the types of discussion we’re having, the kind of relationships we hope to achieve. Sometimes we get there; sometimes we don’t. But what’s important is wanting to connect, wanting to understand someone, wanting to have a deep conversation, even when it is hard and scary, or when it would be so much easier to walk away. There are skills and insights that can help us satisfy that desire for connection, and they are worth learning, practicing, and committing to. Because whether we call it love, or friendship, or simply having a great conversation, achieving connection—authentic, meaningful connection—is the most important thing in life.\n\n\n",

These will help facilitate water storage and improve water quality. NCRS pays all costs associated with recording the easement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The funding for the southern Indiana project is through the Southern Indiana Sentinel Landscape RCPP. The landscape begins about 20 miles south of Indianapolis and contains Department of Defense installations and ranges, six state parks, seven state forests, nine state fish and wildlife areas, 39 state-dedicated nature preserves, one National Forest and three National Wildlife Refuges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the program, forestland owners work with NCRS to place permanent easements on their property. These would ensure that the land remains protected from development and would conserve the delicate habitats and species vital to the local ecosystem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I cannot overemphasize the benefits of restoring, enhancing and protecting our forestland within this project area,” Mortenson said. “This project provides a much greater impact where Indiana’s significant natural resources, species habitat and military training needs intersect.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All applications for the watershed and southern Indiana projects must have applications submitted by Oct. 4.

				"title": "📚 The Coddling of the American Mind",
				"content_html": "<p>Read: <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/\">The Coddling of the American Mind</a> by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended</strong></p>\n<h1 id=\"my-reading-highlights-and-notes\">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-the-search-for-wisdom\">INTRODUCTION The Search for Wisdom</h2>\n<p>This is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread widely in recent years: The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.</p>\n<p>While many propositions are untrue, in order to be classified as a Great Untruth, an idea must meet three criteria: It contradicts ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures). It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.</p>\n<p>We suggested that students were beginning to react to words, books, and visiting speakers with fear and anger because they had been taught to exaggerate danger, use dichotomous (or binary) thinking, amplify their first emotional responses, and engage in a number of other cognitive distortions (which we will discuss further throughout this book). Such thought patterns directly harmed students’ mental health and interfered with their intellectual development—and sometimes the development of those around them.</p>\n<p>At some schools, a culture of defensive self-censorship seemed to be emerging, partly in response to students who were quick to “call out” or shame others for small things that they deemed to be insensitive—either to the student doing the calling out or to members of a group that the student was standing up for. We called this pattern <strong>vindictive protectiveness</strong> and argued that such behavior made it more difficult for all students to have open discussions in which they could practice the essential skills of critical thinking and civil disagreement.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>But <strong>overprotection</strong> is just one part of a larger trend that we <strong>call problems of progress</strong>. This term refers to bad consequences produced by otherwise good social changes.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Comfort and physical safety are boons to humanity, but they bring some costs, too. We adapt to our new and improved circumstances and then lower the bar for what we count as intolerable levels of discomfort and risk.</p>\n<p>Each generation tends to see the one after it as weak, whiny, and lacking in resilience.</p>\n<p>To repeat, we are not saying that the problems facing students, and young people more generally, are minor or “all in their heads.” We are saying that what people choose to do in their heads will determine how those real problems affect them.</p>\n<p>That means seeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality).</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-i-three-bad-ideas\">PART I Three Bad Ideas</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-1-the-untruth-of-fragility-what-doesnt-kill-you-makes-you-weaker\">CHAPTER 1 The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker</h3>\n<p>This is the underlying rationale for what is called the <strong>hygiene hypothesis</strong>, the leading explanation for why allergy rates generally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner—another example of a problem of progress. Developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik explains the hypothesis succinctly and does us the favor of linking it to our mission in this book: Thanks to hygiene, antibiotics and too little outdoor play, children don’t get exposed to microbes as they once did. This may lead them to develop immune systems that overreact to substances that aren’t actually threatening—causing allergies.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Taleb argued that most of us think about risk in the wrong way. In complex systems, it is virtually inevitable that unforeseen problems will arise, yet we persist in trying to calculate risk based on past experiences.</p>\n<p>Taleb asks us to look beyond the overused word “resilience” and recognize that some things are <strong>antifragile</strong>. Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like our immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>But gradually, in the twenty-first century, on some college campuses, the meaning of “safety” underwent a process of “concept creep” and expanded to include “emotional safety.”</p>\n<p>To understand how an Oberlin administrator could have used the word “safety,” we turn to an article published in 2016 by the Australian psychologist Nick Haslam, titled “Concept Creep: Psychology’s Expanding Concepts of Harm and Pathology.”16 Haslam examined a variety of key concepts in clinical and social psychology—including abuse, bullying, trauma, and prejudice—to determine how their usage had changed since the 1980s. He found that their scope had expanded in two directions: the concepts had crept “downward,” to apply to less severe situations, and “outward,” to encompass new but conceptually related phenomena.</p>\n<p>Research on “post-traumatic growth” shows that most people report becoming stronger, or better in some way, after suffering through a traumatic experience. That doesn’t mean we should stop protecting young people from potential trauma, but it does mean that the culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery. It is vital that people who have survived violence become habituated to ordinary cues and reminders woven into the fabric of daily life. <strong>Avoiding triggers is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it.</strong>\n<strong>Tags:</strong> resilient</p>\n<p><strong>“Safetyism”</strong> refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. “Safety” trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>Children, like many other complex adaptive systems, are antifragile. Their brains require a wide range of inputs from their environments in order to configure themselves for those environments. Like the immune system, children must be exposed to challenges and stressors (within limits, and in age-appropriate ways), or they will fail to mature into strong and capable adults, able to engage productively with people and ideas that challenge their beliefs and moral convictions.</p>\n<p>Concepts sometimes creep. Concepts like trauma and safety have expanded so far since the 1980s that they are often employed in ways that are no longer grounded in legitimate psychological research. Grossly expanded conceptions of trauma and safety are now used to justify the overprotection of children of all ages—even college students, who are sometimes said to need safe spaces and trigger warnings lest words and ideas put them in danger.</p>\n<p>Safetyism is the cult of safety—an obsession with eliminating threats (both real and imagined) to the point at which people become unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. Safetyism deprives young people of the experiences that their antifragile minds need, thereby making them more fragile, anxious, and prone to seeing themselves as victims.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-2-the-untruth-of-emotional-reasoning-always-trust-your-feelings\">CHAPTER 2 The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings</h3>\n<p>Beck noticed a common pattern of beliefs, which he called the “cognitive triad” of depression: “I’m no good,” “My world is bleak,” and “My future is hopeless.” Many people experience one or two of these thoughts fleetingly, but depressed people tend to hold all three beliefs in a stable and enduring psychological structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Schemas</strong> refer to the patterns of thoughts and behaviors, built up over time, that people use to process information quickly and effortlessly as they interact with the world.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Beck’s great discovery was that it is possible to break the disempowering feedback cycle between negative beliefs and negative emotions. If you can get people to examine these beliefs and consider counterevidence, it gives them at least some moments of relief from negative emotions, and if you release them from negative emotions, they become more open to questioning their negative beliefs.</p>\n<p>A common finding is that CBT works about as well as Prozac and similar drugs for relieving the symptoms of anxiety disorders and mild to moderate depression, and it does so with longer-lasting benefits and without any negative side effects. But CBT is effective for more than anxiety and depression, including anorexia, bulimia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anger, marital discord, and stress-related disorders.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> health</p>\n<p><strong>EMOTIONAL REASONING</strong>: Letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>CATASTROPHIZING</strong>: Focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely. “It would be terrible if I failed.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>OVERGENERALIZING</strong>: Perceiving a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>DICHOTOMOUS THINKING</strong> (also known variously as “black-and-white thinking,” “all-or-nothing thinking,” and “binary thinking”): Viewing events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>MIND READING</strong>: Assuming that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>LABELING</strong>: Assigning global negative traits to yourself or others (often in the service of dichotomous thinking). “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>NEGATIVE FILTERING</strong>: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>DISCOUNTING POSITIVES</strong>: Claiming that the positive things you or others do are trivial, so that you can maintain a negative judgment. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p><strong>BLAMING</strong>: Focusing on the other person as the source of your negative feelings; you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Everyone engages in these distortions from time to time, so CBT is useful for everyone.</p>\n<p>Greg’s original realization about cognitive distortions was that just learning how to recognize them and rein them in is a good intellectual habit for all of us to cultivate.</p>\n<p>But aggression is not unintentional or accidental. If you bump into someone by accident and never meant them any harm, it is not an act of aggression, although the other person may misperceive it as one.</p>\n<p>But it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as <strong>mind reading</strong>; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>A faux pas does not make someone an evil person or an aggressor.</p>\n<p>It is undeniable that some members of various identity groups encounter repeated indignities because of their group membership. Even if none of the offenders harbored a trace of ill will, their clueless or ignorant questions could become burdensome and hard to tolerate.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> re &ldquo;microaggressions&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The concept of <strong>“locus of control”</strong> goes back to behaviorist days, when psychologists noted that animals (including people) could be trained to expect that they could get what they wanted through their own behavior (that is, some control over outcomes was “internal” to themselves). Conversely, animals could be trained to expect that nothing they did mattered (that is, all control of outcomes was “external” to themselves).\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>A great deal of research shows that having an internal locus of control leads to greater health, happiness, effort expended, success in school, and success at work. An internal locus of control has even been found to make many kinds of adversity less painful.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-1\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>Among the most universal psychological insights in the world’s wisdom traditions is that what really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves but the way in which we think about them, as Epictetus put it.</p>\n<p>CBT is a method anyone can learn for identifying common cognitive distortions and then changing their habitual patterns of thinking. CBT helps the rider (controlled processing) to train the elephant (automatic processing), resulting in better critical thinking and mental health.</p>\n<p>Emotional reasoning is among the most common of all cognitive distortions; most people would be happier and more effective if they did less of it.</p>\n<p>The term <strong>“microaggressions”</strong> refers to a way of thinking about brief and commonplace indignities and slights communicated to people of color (and others). Small acts of aggression are real, so the term could be useful, but because the definition includes accidental and unintentional offenses, the word “aggression” is misleading. Using the lens of microaggressions may amplify the pain experienced and the conflict that ensues. (On the other hand, there is nothing “micro” about intentional acts of aggression and bigotry.)\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>By encouraging students to interpret the actions of others in the least generous way possible, schools that teach students about microaggressions may be encouraging students to engage in emotional reasoning and other distortions while setting themselves up for higher levels of distrust and conflict.</p>\n<p>Karith Foster offers an example of using empathy to reappraise actions that could be interpreted as microaggressions. When she interpreted those actions as innocent (albeit insensitive) misunderstandings, it led to a better outcome for everyone.</p>\n<p>The number of efforts to “disinvite” speakers from giving talks on campus has increased in the last few years; such efforts are often justified by the claim that the speaker in question will cause harm to students. But discomfort is not danger. Students, professors, and administrators should understand the concept of antifragility and keep in mind Hanna Holborn Gray’s principle: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-3-the-untruth-of-us-versus-them-life-is-a-battle-between-good-people-and-evil-people\">CHAPTER 3 The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People</h3>\n<p>There is a principle in philosophy and rhetoric called the <strong>principle of charity</strong>, which says that one should interpret other people’s statements in their best, most reasonable form, not in the worst or most offensive way possible.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Tajfel found that no matter how trivial or “minimal” he made the distinctions between the groups, people tended to distribute whatever was offered in favor of their in-group members. Later studies have used a variety of techniques to reach the same conclusion.</p>\n<p>Any kind of intergroup conflict (real or perceived) immediately turns tribalism up, making people highly attentive to signs that reveal which team another person is on. &hellip; Conditions of peace and prosperity, in contrast, generally turn down the tribalism.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that the human mind is prepared for tribalism. Human evolution is not just the story of individuals competing with other individuals within each group; it’s also the story of groups competing with other groups—sometimes violently.</p>\n<p>But being prepared for tribalism doesn’t mean we have to live in tribal ways. The human mind contains many evolved cognitive “tools.” We don’t use all of them all the time; we draw on our toolbox as needed. Local conditions can turn the tribalism up, down, or off.</p>\n<p><strong>“Identity politics”</strong> is a contentious term, but its basic meaning is simple. Jonathan Rauch, a scholar at The Brookings Institution, defines it as “political mobilization organized around group characteristics such as race, gender, and sexuality, as opposed to party, ideology, or pecuniary interest.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>But how identity is mobilized makes an enormous difference—for the group’s odds of success, for the welfare of the people who join the movement, and for the country. Identity can be mobilized in ways that emphasize an overarching common humanity while making the case that some fellow human beings are denied dignity and rights because they belong to a particular group, or it can be mobilized in ways that amplify our ancient tribalism and bind people together in shared hatred of a group that serves as the unifying common enemy.</p>\n<p>Instead of shaming or demonizing their opponents, they humanized them and then relentlessly appealed to their humanity.</p>\n<p>Intersectionality is a theory based on several insights that we believe are valid and useful: power matters, members of groups sometimes act cruelly or unjustly to preserve their power, and people who are members of multiple identity groups can face various forms of disadvantage in ways that are often invisible to others. &hellip; Our purpose here is not to critique the theory itself; it is, rather, to explore the effects that certain interpretations of intersectionality may now be having on college campuses. The human mind is prepared for tribalism, and these interpretations of intersectionality have the potential to turn tribalism way up. These interpretations of intersectionality teach people to see bipolar dimensions of privilege and oppression as ubiquitous in social interactions.</p>\n<p>a variety of theories and approaches flourished on campus in humanities and social science departments that offered ways of analyzing society through the lens of power relationships among groups. (Examples include deconstructionism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and critical theory.)</p>\n<p>Call-out culture requires an easy way to reach an audience that can award status to people who shame or punish alleged offenders. This is one reason social media has been so transformative: there is always an audience eager to watch people being shamed, particularly when it is so easy for spectators to join in and pile on.</p>\n<p>Life in a call-out culture requires constant vigilance, fear, and self-censorship. Many in the audience may feel sympathy for the person being shamed but are afraid to speak up, yielding the false impression that the audience is unanimous in its condemnation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-2\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The human mind evolved for living in tribes that engaged in frequent (and often violent) conflict; our modern-day minds readily divide the world into “us” and “them,” even on trivial or arbitrary criteria, as Henri Tajfel’s psychological experiments demonstrated.</p>\n<p>Identity politics takes many forms. Some forms, such as that practiced by Martin Luther King, Jr., and Pauli Murray, can be called common-humanity identity politics, because its practitioners humanize their opponents and appeal to their humanity while also applying political pressure in other ways.</p>\n<p>Common-enemy identity politics, on the other hand, tries to unite a coalition using the psychology embedded in the Bedouin proverb “I against my brothers. I and my brothers against my cousins. I and my brothers and my cousins against the world.” It is used on the far right as well as the far left.</p>\n<p>Intersectionality is a popular intellectual framework on campuses today; certain versions of it teach students to see multiple axes of privilege and oppression that intersect. While there are merits to the theory, the way it is interpreted and practiced on campus can sometimes amplify tribal thinking and encourage students to endorse the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.</p>\n<p>Common-enemy identity politics, when combined with microaggression theory, produces a call-out culture in which almost anything one says or does could result in a public shaming. This can engender a sense of “walking on eggshells,” and it teaches students habits of self-censorship. Call-out cultures are detrimental to students’ education and bad for their mental health. Call-out cultures and us-versus-them thinking are incompatible with the educational and research missions of universities, which require free inquiry, dissent, evidence-based argument, and intellectual honesty.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-ii-bad-ideas-in-action\">PART II Bad Ideas in Action</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-4-intimidation-and-violence\">CHAPTER 4 Intimidation and Violence</h3>\n<p>This is another example of concept creep. In just the last few years, the word “violence” has expanded on campus and in some radical political communities beyond campus to cover a multitude of nonviolent actions, including speech that this political faction claims will have a negative impact on members of protected identity groups. Outside of cultures of safetyism, the word “violence” refers to physical violence. The word is sometimes used metaphorically (as in “I violently disagree”), but few of us, including those who claim that speech is violence, have any difficulty understanding the statement “We should reduce incarceration for nonviolent offenses.” However, now that some students, professors, and activists are labeling their opponents’ words as violence, they give themselves permission to engage in ideologically motivated physical violence.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> favorite</p>\n<p>This sentence includes <strong>fortune-telling</strong>, as the students predict what Mac Donald would say. It also includes a rhetorical flourish that became common in 2017: the assertion that a speaker will “deny” people from certain identity groups “the right to exist.”60 This thinking is a form of catastrophizing, in that it inflates the horrors of a speaker’s words far beyond what the speaker might actually say.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>We understand why so many students embraced more active and confrontational forms of protest. But because their activism is often based on an embrace of the Great Untruths and a tendency to attack potential allies, and because aggressive protests are often exactly what right-wing provocateurs are hoping to provoke, we believe that many student activists are harming themselves as well as their causes.</p>\n<p>The more ways your identity can be threatened by casual daily interactions, the more valuable it will be to cultivate the Stoic (and Buddhist, and CBT) ability to not be emotionally reactive, to not let others control your mind and your cortisol levels.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> favorite, health</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-3\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The “Milo Riot” at UC Berkeley on February 1, 2017, marked a major shift in campus protests. Violence was used successfully to stop a speaker; people were injured, and there were (as far as we can tell) no costs to those who were violent. Some students later justified the violence as a legitimate form of “self-defense” to prevent speech that they said was violent.</p>\n<p>Hardly any students say that they themselves would use violence to shut down a speech, but two surveys conducted in late 2017 found that substantial minorities of students (20% in one survey and 30% in the other) said it was sometimes “acceptable” for other students to use violence to prevent a speaker from speaking on campus.</p>\n<p>The “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a white nationalist killed a peaceful counterprotester and injured others, further raised tensions on campus, especially as provocations from far-right groups increased in the months afterward.</p>\n<p>In the fall of 2017, the number of efforts to shut down speakers reached a record level.</p>\n<p>In 2017, the idea that speech can be violence (even when it does not involve threats, harassment, or calls for violence) seemed to spread, assisted by the tendency in some circles to focus only on perceived impact, not on intent. Words that give rise to stress or fear for members of some groups are now often regarded as a form of violence.</p>\n<p>Speech is not violence. Treating it as such is an interpretive choice, and it is a choice that increases pain and suffering while preventing other, more effective responses, including the Stoic response (cultivating nonreactivity) and the antifragile response suggested by Van Jones: “Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-5-witch-hunts\">CHAPTER 5 Witch Hunts</h3>\n<p>Durkheim saw groups and communities as being in some ways like organisms—social entities that have a chronic need to enhance their internal cohesion and their shared sense of moral order.</p>\n<p>Bergesen notes that there are three features common to most political witch hunts: they arise very quickly, they involve charges of crimes against the collective, and the offenses that lead to charges are often trivial or fabricated.</p>\n<p>To Bergesen’s list we’ll add a fourth feature, which necessarily follows from the first three: Fear of defending the accused: When a public accusation is made, many friends and bystanders know that the victim is innocent, but they are afraid to say anything. Anyone who comes to the defense of the accused is obstructing the enactment of a collective ritual. Siding with the accused is truly an offense against the group, and it will be treated as such.</p>\n<p>One of the most brilliant features of universities is that, when they are working properly, they are communities of scholars who cancel out one another’s confirmation biases. Even if professors often cannot see the flaws in their own arguments, other professors and students do them the favor of finding such flaws. The community of scholars then judges which ideas survive the debate. We can call this process <strong>institutionalized disconfirmation</strong>. The institution (the academy as a whole, or a discipline, such as political science) guarantees that every statement offered as a research finding—and certainly every peer-reviewed article—has survived a process of challenge and vetting.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>One of the strongest personality correlates of left-wing politics is the trait of openness to experience, a trait that describes people who crave new ideas and experiences and who tend to be interested in changing traditional arrangements.</p>\n<p>Social conservatives tend to be lower on openness to experience and higher on conscientiousness—they prefer things to be orderly and predictable, they are more likely to show up on time for meetings, and they are more likely to see the value of traditional arrangements.</p>\n<p>Politically homogeneous communities are more susceptible to witch hunts, particularly when they feel threatened from outside.</p>\n<p>Humans are tribal creatures who readily form groups to compete with other groups (as we saw in chapter 3). Sociologist Emile Durkheim’s work illuminates the way those groups engage in rituals—including the collective punishment of deviance—to enhance their cohesion and solidarity.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-4\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>Cohesive and morally homogeneous groups are prone to witch hunts, particularly when they experience a threat, whether from outside or from within.</p>\n<p>Witch hunts generally have four properties: they seem to come out of nowhere; they involve charges of crimes against the collective; the offenses that lead to those charges are often trivial or fabricated; and people who know that the accused is innocent keep quiet, or in extreme cases, they join the mob.</p>\n<p>Some of the most puzzling campus events and trends since 2015 match the profile of a witch hunt. The campus protests at Yale, Claremont McKenna, and Evergreen all began as reactions to politely worded emails, and all led to demands that the authors of the emails be fired. (We repeat that the concerns that provide the context for a witch hunt may be valid, but in a witch hunt, the attendant fears are channeled in unjust and destructive ways.)</p>\n<p>The new trend in 2017 for professors to join open letters denouncing their colleagues and demanding the retraction or condemnation of their work (as happened to Rebecca Tuvel, Amy Wax, and others) also fits this pattern. In all of these cases, colleagues of the accused were afraid to publicly stand up and defend them.</p>\n<p>Viewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. These declines, combined with the rapidly escalating political polarization of the United States (which is our focus in the next chapter), may be part of the reason why the new culture of safetyism has spread so rapidly since its emergence around 2013.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-iii-how-did-we-get-here\">PART III How Did We Get Here?</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-6-the-polarization-cycle\">CHAPTER 6 The Polarization Cycle</h3>\n<p>What is going on? There is no simple answer. In Part III, we present six interacting explanatory threads: rising political polarization and cross-party animosity; rising levels of teen anxiety and depression; changes in parenting practices; the decline of free play; the growth of campus bureaucracy; and a rising passion for justice in response to major national events, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires.</p>\n<p>Before we present these threads, however, we must make two points explicitly and emphatically. The first point is that there are different threads for different people. Part of the complexity of our story is that not all of the threads have influenced each person and group on campus equally. &hellip; The second point is that this is a book about good intentions gone awry. In all of the six chapters in this part of the book, you’ll read about people primarily acting from good or noble motivations. In most cases, the motive is to help or protect children or people seen as vulnerable or victimized. But as we all know, the road to hell can be paved with good intentions. Our goal in Part III is not to blame; it is to understand. Only by identifying and analyzing all six explanatory threads can we begin to talk about possible solutions,</p>\n<p>if we step back and look at American universities as complex institutions nested within a larger society that has been growing steadily more divided, angry, and polarized, we begin to see the left and the right locked into a game of mutual provocation and reciprocal outrage that is an essential piece of the puzzle we are trying to solve in this book.</p>\n<p>Issue Polarization FIGURE 6.1. The distance between Republicans and Democrats, on a set of 10 policy questions, has grown very large since 2004. Differences by race, gender, education, and age have not changed much since 1994. (Source: Pew Research Center.)</p>\n<p>Affective Polarization FIGURE 6.2. Affective partisan polarization. Americans’ feelings toward their own party have barely changed since the 1970s, but Americans have become increasingly “cold” or hostile toward the other party since the 1990s. (Source: American National Election Study,6 plotted by Iyengar and Krupenkin, 2018.)</p>\n<p>From the 1940s to around 1980, American politics was about as centrist and bipartisan as it has ever been.</p>\n<p>These four trends, plus many more, have combined to produce a very unfortunate change in the dynamics of American politics, which political scientists call negative partisanship. In a recent review of data on <strong>“affective polarization”</strong> (the degree to which members of each party feel negatively toward the other party), Iyengar and Krupenkin summarize the change like this:</p>\n<p>Prior to the era of polarization, ingroup favoritism, that is, partisans’ enthusiasm for their party or candidate, was the driving force behind political participation. More recently, however, it is hostility toward the out-party that makes people more inclined to participate. In other words, Americans are now motivated to leave their couches to take part in political action not by love for their party’s candidate but by hatred of the other party’s candidate. Negative partisanship means that American politics is driven less by hope and more by the Untruth of Us Versus Them. “They” must be stopped, at all costs.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Americans are now easily exploitable, and a large network of profit-driven media sites, political entrepreneurs, and foreign intelligence agencies are taking advantage of this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability comes with an unfortunate asymmetry: the faculty and students at universities have shifted to the left since the 1990s, as we showed in the last chapter, while the “outrage industry” of talk radio, cable news networks, and conspiracy websites is more developed and effective on the right.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-5\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization since the 1980s: affective (or emotional) polarization, which means that people who identify with either of the two main political parties increasingly hate and fear the other party and the people in it. This is our first of six explanatory threads that will help us understand what has been changing on campus.</p>\n<p>Affective polarization in the United States is roughly symmetrical, but as university students and faculty have shifted leftward during a time of rising cross-party hatred, universities have begun to receive less trust and more hostility from some conservatives and right-leaning organizations.</p>\n<p>Beginning in 2016, the number of high-profile cases of professors being hounded or harassed from the right for something they said in an interview or on social media began to increase.</p>\n<p>Rising political polarization, accompanied by increases in racial and political provocation from the right, usually directed from off-campus to on-campus targets, is an essential part of the story of why behavior is changing on campus, particularly since 2016.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-7-anxiety-and-depression\">CHAPTER 7 Anxiety and Depression</h3>\n<p>In the new discussions about safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, and speech as violence, students often employed arguments and justifications that seemed to come right out of the CBT training manual.</p>\n<p>Twenge finds that there are just two activities that are significantly correlated with depression and other suicide-related outcomes (such as considering suicide, making a plan, or making an actual attempt):</p>\n<p>electronic device use (such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer) and watching TV.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are five activities that have inverse relationships with depression (meaning that kids who spend more hours per week on these activities show lower rates of depression):</p>\n<p>sports and other forms of exercise, attending religious services, reading books and other print media, in-person social interactions, and doing homework</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite, health</p>\n<p>The second reason that social media may be harder on girls is that girls and boys are aggressive in different ways. Research by psychologist Nicki Crick shows that boys are more physically aggressive—more likely to shove and hit one another, and they show a greater interest in stories and movies about physical aggression. Girls, in contrast, are more “relationally” aggressive; they try to hurt their rivals’ relationships, reputations, and social status—for example, by using social media to make sure other girls know who is intentionally being left out.33 When you add it all up, there’s no overall sex difference in total aggression, but there’s a large and consistent sex difference in the preferred ways of harming others. (At least, that was Crick’s finding in the 1990s, before the birth of social media.) Plus, if boys’ aggression is generally delivered in person, then the targets of boys’ aggression can escape from it when they go home. On social media, girls can never escape.</p>\n<p>Safetyism also inflicts collateral damage on the university’s culture of free inquiry, because it teaches students to see words as violence and to interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous, rather than merely as true versus false. That way of thinking about words is likely to promote the intensification of a call-out culture, which, of course, gives students one more reason to be anxious.</p>\n<p>So we don’t want to create a moral panic and frighten parents into banning all devices until their kids turn twenty-one. These are complicated issues, and much more research is needed. In the meantime, as we’ll say in chapter 12, there is enough evidence to support placing time limits on device use (perhaps two hours a day for adolescents, less for younger kids) while limiting or prohibiting the use of platforms that amplify social comparison rather than social connection.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-6\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The national rise in adolescent anxiety and depression that began around 2011 is our second explanatory thread.</p>\n<p>The generation born between 1995 and 2012, called iGen (or sometimes Gen Z), is very different from the Millennials, the generation that preceded it. According to Jean Twenge, an expert in the study of generational differences, one difference is that iGen is growing up more slowly. On average, eighteen-year-olds today have spent less time unsupervised and have hit fewer developmental milestones on the path to autonomy (such as getting a job or a driver’s license), compared with eighteen-year-olds in previous generations.</p>\n<p>A second difference is that iGen has far higher rates of anxiety and depression. The increases for girls and young women are generally much larger than for boys and young men. The increases do not just reflect changing definitions or standards; they show up in rising hospital admission rates of self-harm and in rising suicide rates. The suicide rate of adolescent boys is still higher than that of girls, but the suicide rate of adolescent girls has doubled since 2007.</p>\n<p>According to Twenge, the primary cause of the increase in mental illness is frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices. Less than two hours a day seems to have no deleterious effects, but adolescents who spend several hours a day interacting with screens, particularly if they start in their early teen years or younger, have worse mental health outcomes than do adolescents who use these devices less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.</p>\n<p>Girls may be suffering more than boys because they are more adversely affected by social comparisons (especially based on digitally enhanced beauty), by signals that they are being left out, and by relational aggression, all of which became easier to enact and harder to escape when adolescents acquired smartphones and social media.</p>\n<p>iGen’s arrival at college coincides exactly with the arrival and intensification of the culture of safetyism from 2013 to 2017. Members of iGen may be especially attracted to the overprotection offered by the culture of safetyism on many campuses because of students’ higher levels of anxiety and depression. Both depression and anxiety cause changes in cognition, including a tendency to see the world as more dangerous and hostile than it really is.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-8-paranoid-parenting\">CHAPTER 8 Paranoid Parenting</h3>\n<p>When you combine the giant crime wave that began in the 1960s with the rapid spread of cable TV in the 1980s, including news channels that offered round-the-clock coverage of missing-child cases, you can see why American parents grew fearful and defensive by the 1990s. The crime wave ended rather abruptly in the early 1990s, when rates of nearly all crimes began to plummet all over the United States. In 2013, for example, the murder rate dropped to the same level it had been at sixty years earlier. Nevertheless, the fear of crime did not diminish along with the crime rate, and the new habits of fearful parenting seem to have become new national norms. American parenting is now wildly out of sync with the actual risk that strangers pose to children.</p>\n<p>The lesson we draw from this brief review of research on social class and parenting is that although kids are naturally antifragile, there are two very different ways to damage their development. One is to neglect and underprotect them, exposing them early to severe and chronic adversity. This has happened to some of today’s college students, particularly those from working-class or poor families. The other is to overmonitor and overprotect them, denying them the thousands of small challenges, risks, and adversities that they need to face on their own in order to become strong and resilient adults.</p>\n<p>Paranoid parenting is a powerful way to teach kids all three of the Great Untruths.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-7\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>Paranoid parenting is our third explanatory thread.</p>\n<p>When we overprotect children, we harm them. Children are naturally antifragile, so overprotection makes them weaker and less resilient later on.</p>\n<p>Children today have far more restricted childhoods, on average, than those enjoyed by their parents, who grew up in far more dangerous times and yet had many more opportunities to develop their intrinsic antifragility. Compared with previous generations, younger Millennials and especially members of iGen (born in and after 1995) have been deprived of unsupervised time for play and exploration. They have missed out on many of the challenges, negative experiences, and minor risks that help children develop into strong, competent, and independent adults (as we’ll show in the next chapter).</p>\n<p>Children in the United States and other prosperous countries are safer today than at any other point in history. Yet for a variety of historical reasons, fear of abduction is still very high among American parents, many of whom have come to believe that children should never be without adult supervision. When children are repeatedly led to believe that the world is dangerous and that they cannot face it alone, we should not be surprised if many of them believe it.</p>\n<p>Helicopter parenting combined with laws and social norms that make it hard to give kids unsupervised time may be having a negative impact on the mental health and resilience of young people today.</p>\n<p>There are large social class differences in parenting styles. Families in the middle class (and above) tend to use a style that sociologist Annette Lareau calls “concerted cultivation,” in contrast to the “natural growth parenting” used by families in the working class (and below). Some college students from wealthier families may have been rendered more fragile from overparenting and oversupervision. College students from poorer backgrounds are exposed to a very different set of risks, including potential exposure to chronic, severe adversity, which is especially detrimental to resilience when children lack caring relationships with adults who can buffer stress and help them turn adversity into growth.</p>\n<p>Paranoid parenting prepares today’s children to embrace the three Great Untruths, which means that when they go to college, they are psychologically primed to join a culture of safetyism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-9-the-decline-of-play\">CHAPTER 9 The Decline of Play</h3>\n<p>In species that are predators, such as wolves, their pups seem to prefer to be the chasers. In species that are prey, such as rats, the pups prefer to be chased. Our primate ancestors were both prey and predator, but they were prey for much longer. That may be why human children particularly enjoy practicing their fleeing and hiding skills.</p>\n<p>A key concept from developmental biology is <strong>“experience-expectant development.”</strong>\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Peter Gray, a leading researcher of play, defines <strong>“free play”</strong> as “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>When asked to select reasons to explain why their children didn’t spend more time on outdoor play, 82% of the mothers chose “safety concerns,” including the fear of crime. But there’s a second reason, a second fear that haunts American parents and children—particularly those in the middle class and above—far more than it did in the late twentieth century: the college admissions process.</p>\n<p>But “grit is often misunderstood as perseverance without passion, and that’s tragic,” psychology professor Angela Duckworth, author of the book Grit, told us. “Perseverance without passion is mere drudgery.” She wants young people to “devote themselves to pursuits that are intrinsically fulfilling.”</p>\n<p>Of greatest importance in free play is that it is always voluntary; anyone can quit at any time and disrupt the activity, so children must pay close attention to the needs and concerns of others if they want to keep the game going. They must work out conflicts over fairness on their own; no adult can be called upon to side with one child against another.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-8\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The decline of unsupervised free play is our fourth explanatory thread. Children, like other mammals, need free play in order to finish the intricate wiring process of neural development. Children deprived of free play are likely to be less competent—physically and socially—as adults. They are likely to be less tolerant of risk, and more prone to anxiety disorders.</p>\n<p>Free play, according to Peter Gray, is “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.” This is the kind of play that play experts say is most valuable for children, yet it is also the kind of play that has declined most sharply in the lives of American children.</p>\n<p>The decline in free play was likely driven by several factors, including an unrealistic fear of strangers and kidnapping (since the 1980s); the rising competitiveness for admission to top universities (over many decades); a rising emphasis on testing, test preparation, and homework; and a corresponding deemphasis on physical and social skills (since the early 2000s).</p>\n<p>The rising availability of smartphones and social media interacted with these other trends, and the combination has greatly changed the way American children spend their time and the kinds of physical and social experiences that guide the intricate wiring process of neural development.</p>\n<p>Free play helps children develop the skills of cooperation and dispute resolution that are closely related to the “art of association” upon which democracies depend. When citizens are not skilled in this art, they are less able to work out the ordinary conflicts of daily life. They will more frequently call for authorities to apply coercive force to their opponents. They will be more likely to welcome the bureaucracy of safetyism.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-10-the-bureaucracy-of-safetyism\">CHAPTER 10 The Bureaucracy of Safetyism</h3>\n<p>In 1963, Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California system, called the resulting structure the <strong>“multiversity.”</strong> In a multiversity, different departments and power structures within a university pursue different goals in parallel—for example, research, education, fundraising, branding, and legal compliance.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>A less immediately obvious downside is that goals other than academic excellence begin to take priority as universities come to resemble large corporations—a trend often bemoaned as <strong>“corporatization.”</strong>\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Eric Adler, a classics professor at the University of Maryland, distilled the argument in a 2018 Washington Post article. “The fundamental cause [of campus intolerance],” he suggests, “isn’t students’ extreme leftism or any other political ideology” but “a market-driven decision by universities, made decades ago, to treat students as consumers</p>\n<p>Even at public universities, 18-year-olds are purchasing what is essentially a luxury product. Is it any wonder they feel entitled to control the experience?</p>\n<p>Overreaction and overregulation are usually the work of people within bureaucratic structures who have developed a mindset commonly known as CYA (Cover Your Ass). They know they can be held responsible for any problem that arises on their watch, especially if they took no action to prevent it, so they often adopt a defensive stance.</p>\n<p>Young people have come to believe that danger lurks everywhere, even in the classroom, and even in private conversations.</p>\n<p>Of course, there should be an easy way to report cases of true harassment and employment discrimination; such actions are immoral and unlawful. But bias alone is not harassment or discrimination.</p>\n<p>In 2013, the Departments of Education and Justice issued a sweeping new definition of harassment: any “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” including “verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct.” This definition was not limited to speech that would be offensive to a reasonable person, nor did it require that the alleged target actually be offended—both requirements of traditional harassment claims. By eliminating the reasonable-person standard, harassment was left to be defined by the self-reported subjective experience of every member of the university community. It was, in effect, emotional reasoning turned into a federal regulation.</p>\n<p>In a prescient essay in 2014, two sociologists—Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning—explained where this new culture of vulnerability came from and how administrative actions helped it to grow. They called it -<strong>“victimhood culture,”</strong> and they interpreted it as a new moral order that was in conflict with the older “dignity culture,” which is still dominant in most parts of the United States and other Western democracies.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>This is in contrast to the older “honor cultures,” in which men were so obsessed with guarding their reputations that they were expected to react violently to minor insults made against them or those close to them—perhaps with a challenge to a duel.</p>\n<p>They defined a victimhood culture as having three distinct attributes: First, “individuals and groups display high sensitivity to slight”; second, they “have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to third parties”; and third, they “seek to cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assistance.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-9\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>The growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of its protective mission is our fifth explanatory thread.</p>\n<p>Administrators generally have good intentions; they are trying to protect the university and its students. But good intentions can sometimes lead to policies that are bad for students.</p>\n<p>In response to a variety of factors, including federal mandates and the risk of lawsuits, the number of campus administrators has grown more rapidly than the number of professors, and professors have gradually come to play a smaller role in the administration of universities. The result has been a trend toward “corporatization.”</p>\n<p>At the same time, market pressures, along with an increasingly consumerist mentality about higher education, have encouraged universities to compete on the basis of the amenities they offer, leading them to think of students as customers whom they must please.</p>\n<p>Campus administrators must juggle many responsibilities and protect the university from many kinds of liabilities, so they tend to adopt a “better safe than sorry” (or “CYA”) approach to issuing new regulations. The proliferation of regulations over time conveys a sense of imminent danger even when there is little or no real threat. In this way, administrators model multiple cognitive distortions, promote the Untruth of Fragility, and contribute to the culture of safetyism.</p>\n<p>Some of the regulations promulgated by administrators restrict freedom of speech, often with highly subjective definitions of key concepts. These rules contribute to an attitude on campus that chills speech, in part by suggesting that freedom of speech can or should be restricted because of some students’ emotional discomfort. This teaches catastrophizing and mind reading (among other cognitive distortions) and promotes the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning.</p>\n<p>One recent administrative innovation is the creation of “Bias Response Lines” and “Bias Response Teams,” which make it easy for members of a campus community to report one another anonymously for “bias.” This “feel something, say something” approach is likely to erode trust within a community. It may also make professors less willing to try innovative or provocative teaching methods; they, too, may develop a CYA approach. More generally, efforts to protect students by creating bureaucratic means of resolving problems and conflicts can have the unintended consequence of fostering moral dependence, which may reduce students’ ability to resolve conflicts independently both during and after college.</p>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-11-the-quest-for-justice\">CHAPTER 11 The Quest for Justice</h3>\n<p>there is a window of higher impressionability running from about age fourteen to twenty-four, with its peak right around age eighteen. Political events—or perhaps the overall zeitgeist as people perceive it—are more likely to “stick” during that period than outside that age range.</p>\n<p>Today’s college students have lived through extraordinary times, and, as a result, many of them have developed an extraordinary passion for social justice. That passion, which drives some of the changes we are seeing on college campuses in recent years, is our sixth explanatory thread.</p>\n<h4 id=\"intuitive-justice\">Intuitive Justice</h4>\n<p><strong>Intuitive justice</strong> is the combination of distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Proportionality is the heart of <strong>“equity theory,”</strong> the major theory of distributive justice in social psychology. Its core assertion is that when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants, people perceive that to be equitable, or fair.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>An early study testing equity theory found that when people were led to believe that they were being overpaid for a job, they worked harder in order to deserve the pay—to get their ratio back into line.</p>\n<p>people are much more willing to accept a decision or action, even one that goes against themselves, when they perceive that the process that led to the decision was fair.</p>\n<p>There are two basic concerns that people bring to their judgments of procedural justice. The first is how the decision is being made. &hellip; The second basic concern is how a person is being treated along the way,</p>\n<p>If you want to motivate people to support a new policy or join a movement in the name of justice, you need to activate in them a clear perception, or intuition, that someone didn’t get what he or she deserved (distributive injustice) or that someone was a victim of an unfair process (procedural injustice).</p>\n<h4 id=\"proportional-procedural-social-justice\">Proportional-Procedural Social Justice</h4>\n<p>Here’s a definition of <strong>social justice</strong> that accords with intuitive notions of justice, from the National Association of Social Workers: “Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social workers aim to open the doors of access and opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Using that definition of social justice, we’ll define <strong>proportional-procedural social justice</strong> as the effort to find and fix cases where distributive or procedural justice is denied to people because they were born into poverty or belong to a socially disadvantaged category.\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>In our account, proportional-procedural social justice falls entirely within the larger domain of intuitive justice. That doesn’t mean we should discard the term “social justice.” Some injustices based on race, gender, or other factors (and their intersections) are obvious, but others are subtle, and people who do not experience them can be unaware of them (as Kimberlé Crenshaw noted). It is useful to have specialists within the domain of justice research who focus on this subset of injustices. Furthermore, when such injustices are pointed out, members of the majority group are often motivated to ignore or deny them.</p>\n<h4 id=\"equal-outcomes-social-justice\">Equal-Outcomes Social Justice</h4>\n<p>When the federal government pressures universities to achieve equal outcomes in the face of unequal inputs, administrators do what they can to protect the institution. That might require them to violate procedural justice, distributive justice, and honesty along the way.</p>\n<p>Most people want individuals to be treated well, and they recoil from cases where individuals are treated unfairly in order to bring about some kind of group-level equality. This is why quotas generally produce such strong backlash: they mandate a violation of procedural justice (people are treated differently based on their race, sex, or some other factor) and distributive justice (rewards are not proportional to inputs) to achieve a specific end-state of equal outcomes.</p>\n<p>When you see a situation in which some groups are underrepresented, it is an invitation to investigate and find out whether there are obstacles, a hostile climate, or systemic factors that have a disparate impact on members of those groups.</p>\n<h4 id=\"correlation-does-not-imply-causation\">Correlation Does Not Imply Causation</h4>\n<p>If professors and students are hesitant to raise alternative explanations for outcome gaps, then theories about those gaps may harden into orthodoxy. Ideas may be accepted not because they are true but because the politically dominant group wants them to be true in order to promote its preferred narrative and preferred set of remedies.</p>\n<p>Students today are fighting for many causes that we believe are noble, too, including ending racial injustices in the legal system and in encounters with the police; providing equal educational and other opportunities for everyone, regardless of circumstances at birth; and extinguishing cultural habits that encourage or enable sexual harassment and gender inequalities. On these and many other issues, we think student protesters are on the “right side of history,” and we support their goals. But if activists embrace the equal-outcomes form of social justice—if they interpret all deviations from population norms as evidence of systemic bias—then they will get drawn into endless and counterproductive campaigns, even against people who share their goals. Along the way, they will reinforce the bad mental habits that we have described throughout the book.</p>\n<p>As long as activists keep their eyes on the two components of intuitive justice that all of us carry in our minds—distributive and procedural—they will apply their efforts where they are likely to do the most good, and they will win more widespread support along the way.</p>\n<h4 id=\"in-sum-10\">In Sum</h4>\n<p>People’s ordinary, everyday, intuitive notions of justice include two major types: distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).</p>\n<p>The most common way that people think about distributive justice is captured by equity theory, which states that things are perceived to be fair when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants.</p>\n<p>Procedural justice is about how decisions are being made, and is also about how people are treated along the way, as procedures unfold.</p>\n<p>Social justice is a central concept in campus life today, and it takes a variety of forms. When social justice efforts are fully consistent with both distributive and procedural justice, we call it proportional-procedural social justice. Such efforts generally aim to remove barriers to equality of opportunity and also to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity.</p>\n<p>But when social justice efforts aim to achieve equality of outcomes by group, and when social justice activists are willing to violate distributive or procedural fairness for some individuals along the way, these efforts violate many people’s sense of intuitive justice. We call this equal-outcomes social justice.</p>\n<p>Correlation does not imply causation. Yet in many discussions in universities these days, the correlation of a demographic trait or identity group membership with an outcome gap is taken as evidence that discrimination (structural or individual) caused the outcome gap. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t, but if people can’t raise alternative possible causal explanations without eliciting negative consequences, then the community is unlikely to arrive at an accurate understanding of the problem. And without understanding the true nature of a problem, there is little chance of solving it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-iv-wising-up\">PART IV Wising Up</h2>\n<h3 id=\"chapter-12-wiser-kids\">CHAPTER 12 Wiser Kids</h3>\n<p>We therefore offer these suggestions with the caveat that any effort to change one part of children’s lives can produce unexpected effects in some other part.

The specific details for practicing CBT differ from book to book and therapist to therapist, but the basic process is something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you are feeling anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed, take a moment to write down what you are feeling.</li>\n<li>Write down your level of distress. (For example, you could score it on a scale of 1 to 100.)</li>\n<li>Write down what happened and what your automatic thoughts were when you felt the pang of anxiety or despair. (For example, “Someone I was interested in canceled our date. I said to myself, ‘This always happens. No one will ever want to go out with me. I’m a total loser.’”)</li>\n<li>Look at the categories of distorted automatic thoughts below, and ask yourself: Is this thought a cognitive distortion? Write down the cognitive distortions you notice. (For example, looking at the automatic thoughts in number 3 above, you might write, “personalizing, overgeneralizing, labeling, and catastrophizing.”)</li>\n<li>Look at the evidence for and against your thought.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself what someone might say who disagreed with you. Is there any merit in that opinion?</li>\n<li>Consider again what happened, and reevaluate the situation without the cognitive distortions.</li>\n<li>Write down your new thoughts and feelings. (For example, “I am sad and disappointed that a date I was excited about got canceled.”)</li>\n<li>Write down again, using the same scale as before, how anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed you feel. Chances are the number will be lower—perhaps a lot lower.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Categories of Distorted Automatic Thoughts</p>\n<ul>\n<li>MIND READING: You assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”</li>\n<li>FORTUNE-TELLING: You predict the future negatively: Things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam,” or “I won’t get the job.”</li>\n<li>CATASTROPHIZING: You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”</li>\n<li>LABELING: You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”</li>\n<li>DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”</li>\n<li>NEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.” *\nOVERGENERALIZING: You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”</li>\n<li>DICHOTOMOUS THINKING: You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”</li>\n<li>SHOULDS: You interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than simply focusing on what is. “I should do well. If I don’t, then I’m a failure.”</li>\n<li>PERSONALIZING: You attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative events, and you fail to see that certain events are also caused by others. “The marriage ended because I failed.”</li>\n<li>BLAMING: You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”</li>\n<li>UNFAIR COMPARISONS: You interpret events in terms of standards that are unrealistic—for example, you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison. “She’s more successful than I am,” or “Others did better than I did on the test.”</li>\n<li>REGRET ORIENTATION: You focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past, rather than on what you can do better now. “I could have had a better job if I had tried,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.”</li>\n<li>WHAT IF?: You keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”</li>\n<li>EMOTIONAL REASONING: You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”</li>\n<li>INABILITY TO DISCONFIRM: You reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought “I’m unlovable,” you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.&quot;</li>\n<li>JUDGMENT FOCUS: You view yourself, others, and events in terms of evaluations as good–bad or superior–inferior, rather than simply describing, accepting, or understanding. You are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standards, and finding that you and others fall short. You are focused on the judgments of others as well as your own judgments of yourself. “I didn’t perform well in college,” or “If I take up tennis, I won’t do well,” or “Look how successful she is.

				"content_text": "Read: [The Coddling of the American Mind](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/) by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt \n\n**Recommended**\n\n# My Reading Highlights and Notes\n\n## INTRODUCTION The Search for Wisdom\n\n<!--more-->\n\nThis is a book about three Great Untruths that seem to have spread widely in recent years: The Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker. The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings. The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.\n\n\nWhile many propositions are untrue, in order to be classified as a Great Untruth, an idea must meet three criteria: It contradicts ancient wisdom (ideas found widely in the wisdom literatures of many cultures). It contradicts modern psychological research on well-being. It harms the individuals and communities who embrace it.\n\n\nWe suggested that students were beginning to react to words, books, and visiting speakers with fear and anger because they had been taught to exaggerate danger, use dichotomous (or binary) thinking, amplify their first emotional responses, and engage in a number of other cognitive distortions (which we will discuss further throughout this book). Such thought patterns directly harmed students’ mental health and interfered with their intellectual development—and sometimes the development of those around them.\n\n\nAt some schools, a culture of defensive self-censorship seemed to be emerging, partly in response to students who were quick to “call out” or shame others for small things that they deemed to be insensitive—either to the student doing the calling out or to members of a group that the student was standing up for. We called this pattern __vindictive protectiveness__ and argued that such behavior made it more difficult for all students to have open discussions in which they could practice the essential skills of critical thinking and civil disagreement.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBut __overprotection__ is just one part of a larger trend that we __call problems of progress__. This term refers to bad consequences produced by otherwise good social changes.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nComfort and physical safety are boons to humanity, but they bring some costs, too. We adapt to our new and improved circumstances and then lower the bar for what we count as intolerable levels of discomfort and risk.\n\n\nEach generation tends to see the one after it as weak, whiny, and lacking in resilience.\n\n\nTo repeat, we are not saying that the problems facing students, and young people more generally, are minor or “all in their heads.” We are saying that what people choose to do in their heads will determine how those real problems affect them.\n\n\nThat means seeking out challenges (rather than eliminating or avoiding everything that “feels unsafe”), freeing yourself from cognitive distortions (rather than always trusting your initial feelings), and taking a generous view of other people, and looking for nuance (rather than assuming the worst about people within a simplistic us-versus-them morality).\n\n\n## PART I Three Bad Ideas\n\n\n### CHAPTER 1 The Untruth of Fragility: What Doesn’t Kill You Makes You Weaker\n\n\nThis is the underlying rationale for what is called the __hygiene hypothesis__, the leading explanation for why allergy rates generally go up as countries get wealthier and cleaner—another example of a problem of progress. Developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik explains the hypothesis succinctly and does us the favor of linking it to our mission in this book: Thanks to hygiene, antibiotics and too little outdoor play, children don’t get exposed to microbes as they once did. This may lead them to develop immune systems that overreact to substances that aren’t actually threatening—causing allergies.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nTaleb argued that most of us think about risk in the wrong way. In complex systems, it is virtually inevitable that unforeseen problems will arise, yet we persist in trying to calculate risk based on past experiences.\n\n\nTaleb asks us to look beyond the overused word “resilience” and recognize that some things are __antifragile__. Many of the important systems in our economic and political life are like our immune systems: they require stressors and challenges in order to learn, adapt, and grow. Systems that are antifragile become rigid, weak, and inefficient when nothing challenges them or pushes them to respond vigorously.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBut gradually, in the twenty-first century, on some college campuses, the meaning of “safety” underwent a process of “concept creep” and expanded to include “emotional safety.”\n\n\nTo understand how an Oberlin administrator could have used the word “safety,” we turn to an article published in 2016 by the Australian psychologist Nick Haslam, titled “Concept Creep: Psychology’s Expanding Concepts of Harm and Pathology.”16 Haslam examined a variety of key concepts in clinical and social psychology—including abuse, bullying, trauma, and prejudice—to determine how their usage had changed since the 1980s. He found that their scope had expanded in two directions: the concepts had crept “downward,” to apply to less severe situations, and “outward,” to encompass new but conceptually related phenomena.\n\n\nResearch on “post-traumatic growth” shows that most people report becoming stronger, or better in some way, after suffering through a traumatic experience. That doesn’t mean we should stop protecting young people from potential trauma, but it does mean that the culture of safetyism is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of human nature and of the dynamics of trauma and recovery. It is vital that people who have survived violence become habituated to ordinary cues and reminders woven into the fabric of daily life. __Avoiding triggers is a symptom of PTSD, not a treatment for it.__\n**Tags:** resilient\n\n\n__“Safetyism”__ refers to a culture or belief system in which safety has become a sacred value, which means that people become unwilling to make trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. “Safety” trumps everything else, no matter how unlikely or trivial the potential danger.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nChildren, like many other complex adaptive systems, are antifragile. Their brains require a wide range of inputs from their environments in order to configure themselves for those environments. Like the immune system, children must be exposed to challenges and stressors (within limits, and in age-appropriate ways), or they will fail to mature into strong and capable adults, able to engage productively with people and ideas that challenge their beliefs and moral convictions.\n\n\nConcepts sometimes creep. Concepts like trauma and safety have expanded so far since the 1980s that they are often employed in ways that are no longer grounded in legitimate psychological research. Grossly expanded conceptions of trauma and safety are now used to justify the overprotection of children of all ages—even college students, who are sometimes said to need safe spaces and trigger warnings lest words and ideas put them in danger.\n\n\nSafetyism is the cult of safety—an obsession with eliminating threats (both real and imagined) to the point at which people become unwilling to make reasonable trade-offs demanded by other practical and moral concerns. Safetyism deprives young people of the experiences that their antifragile minds need, thereby making them more fragile, anxious, and prone to seeing themselves as victims.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 2 The Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always Trust Your Feelings\n\n\nBeck noticed a common pattern of beliefs, which he called the “cognitive triad” of depression: “I’m no good,” “My world is bleak,” and “My future is hopeless.” Many people experience one or two of these thoughts fleetingly, but depressed people tend to hold all three beliefs in a stable and enduring psychological structure.\n\n\n__Schemas__ refer to the patterns of thoughts and behaviors, built up over time, that people use to process information quickly and effortlessly as they interact with the world.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBeck’s great discovery was that it is possible to break the disempowering feedback cycle between negative beliefs and negative emotions. If you can get people to examine these beliefs and consider counterevidence, it gives them at least some moments of relief from negative emotions, and if you release them from negative emotions, they become more open to questioning their negative beliefs.\n\n\nA common finding is that CBT works about as well as Prozac and similar drugs for relieving the symptoms of anxiety disorders and mild to moderate depression, and it does so with longer-lasting benefits and without any negative side effects. But CBT is effective for more than anxiety and depression, including anorexia, bulimia, obsessive compulsive disorder, anger, marital discord, and stress-related disorders.\n**Tags:** health\n\n\n__EMOTIONAL REASONING__: Letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__CATASTROPHIZING__: Focusing on the worst possible outcome and seeing it as most likely. “It would be terrible if I failed.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__OVERGENERALIZING__: Perceiving a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__DICHOTOMOUS THINKING__ (also known variously as “black-and-white thinking,” “all-or-nothing thinking,” and “binary thinking”): Viewing events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__MIND READING__: Assuming that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__LABELING__: Assigning global negative traits to yourself or others (often in the service of dichotomous thinking). “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__NEGATIVE FILTERING__: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__DISCOUNTING POSITIVES__: Claiming that the positive things you or others do are trivial, so that you can maintain a negative judgment. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\n__BLAMING__: Focusing on the other person as the source of your negative feelings; you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nEveryone engages in these distortions from time to time, so CBT is useful for everyone.\n\n\nGreg’s original realization about cognitive distortions was that just learning how to recognize them and rein them in is a good intellectual habit for all of us to cultivate.\n\n\nBut aggression is not unintentional or accidental. If you bump into someone by accident and never meant them any harm, it is not an act of aggression, although the other person may misperceive it as one.\n\n\nBut it is not a good idea to start by assuming the worst about people and reading their actions as uncharitably as possible. This is the distortion known as __mind reading__; if done habitually and negatively, it is likely to lead to despair, anxiety, and a network of damaged relationships.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nA faux pas does not make someone an evil person or an aggressor.\n\n\nIt is undeniable that some members of various identity groups encounter repeated indignities because of their group membership. Even if none of the offenders harbored a trace of ill will, their clueless or ignorant questions could become burdensome and hard to tolerate.\n\n**Note:** re \"microaggressions\"\n\n\nThe concept of __“locus of control”__ goes back to behaviorist days, when psychologists noted that animals (including people) could be trained to expect that they could get what they wanted through their own behavior (that is, some control over outcomes was “internal” to themselves). Conversely, animals could be trained to expect that nothing they did mattered (that is, all control of outcomes was “external” to themselves).\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nA great deal of research shows that having an internal locus of control leads to greater health, happiness, effort expended, success in school, and success at work. An internal locus of control has even been found to make many kinds of adversity less painful.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nAmong the most universal psychological insights in the world’s wisdom traditions is that what really frightens and dismays us is not external events themselves but the way in which we think about them, as Epictetus put it.\n\n\nCBT is a method anyone can learn for identifying common cognitive distortions and then changing their habitual patterns of thinking. CBT helps the rider (controlled processing) to train the elephant (automatic processing), resulting in better critical thinking and mental health.\n\n\nEmotional reasoning is among the most common of all cognitive distortions; most people would be happier and more effective if they did less of it.\n\n\nThe term __“microaggressions”__ refers to a way of thinking about brief and commonplace indignities and slights communicated to people of color (and others). Small acts of aggression are real, so the term could be useful, but because the definition includes accidental and unintentional offenses, the word “aggression” is misleading. Using the lens of microaggressions may amplify the pain experienced and the conflict that ensues. (On the other hand, there is nothing “micro” about intentional acts of aggression and bigotry.)\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBy encouraging students to interpret the actions of others in the least generous way possible, schools that teach students about microaggressions may be encouraging students to engage in emotional reasoning and other distortions while setting themselves up for higher levels of distrust and conflict.\n\n\nKarith Foster offers an example of using empathy to reappraise actions that could be interpreted as microaggressions. When she interpreted those actions as innocent (albeit insensitive) misunderstandings, it led to a better outcome for everyone.\n\n\nThe number of efforts to “disinvite” speakers from giving talks on campus has increased in the last few years; such efforts are often justified by the claim that the speaker in question will cause harm to students. But discomfort is not danger. Students, professors, and administrators should understand the concept of antifragility and keep in mind Hanna Holborn Gray’s principle: “Education should not be intended to make people comfortable; it is meant to make them think.”\n\n\n### CHAPTER 3 The Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life Is a Battle Between Good People and Evil People\n\n\nThere is a principle in philosophy and rhetoric called the __principle of charity__, which says that one should interpret other people’s statements in their best, most reasonable form, not in the worst or most offensive way possible.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nTajfel found that no matter how trivial or “minimal” he made the distinctions between the groups, people tended to distribute whatever was offered in favor of their in-group members. Later studies have used a variety of techniques to reach the same conclusion.\n\n\nAny kind of intergroup conflict (real or perceived) immediately turns tribalism up, making people highly attentive to signs that reveal which team another person is on. ... Conditions of peace and prosperity, in contrast, generally turn down the tribalism.\n\n\nThe bottom line is that the human mind is prepared for tribalism. Human evolution is not just the story of individuals competing with other individuals within each group; it’s also the story of groups competing with other groups—sometimes violently.\n\n\nBut being prepared for tribalism doesn’t mean we have to live in tribal ways. The human mind contains many evolved cognitive “tools.” We don’t use all of them all the time; we draw on our toolbox as needed. Local conditions can turn the tribalism up, down, or off.\n\n\n__“Identity politics”__ is a contentious term, but its basic meaning is simple. Jonathan Rauch, a scholar at The Brookings Institution, defines it as “political mobilization organized around group characteristics such as race, gender, and sexuality, as opposed to party, ideology, or pecuniary interest.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nBut how identity is mobilized makes an enormous difference—for the group’s odds of success, for the welfare of the people who join the movement, and for the country. Identity can be mobilized in ways that emphasize an overarching common humanity while making the case that some fellow human beings are denied dignity and rights because they belong to a particular group, or it can be mobilized in ways that amplify our ancient tribalism and bind people together in shared hatred of a group that serves as the unifying common enemy.\n\n\nInstead of shaming or demonizing their opponents, they humanized them and then relentlessly appealed to their humanity.\n\n\nIntersectionality is a theory based on several insights that we believe are valid and useful: power matters, members of groups sometimes act cruelly or unjustly to preserve their power, and people who are members of multiple identity groups can face various forms of disadvantage in ways that are often invisible to others. ... Our purpose here is not to critique the theory itself; it is, rather, to explore the effects that certain interpretations of intersectionality may now be having on college campuses. The human mind is prepared for tribalism, and these interpretations of intersectionality have the potential to turn tribalism way up. These interpretations of intersectionality teach people to see bipolar dimensions of privilege and oppression as ubiquitous in social interactions.\n\n\na variety of theories and approaches flourished on campus in humanities and social science departments that offered ways of analyzing society through the lens of power relationships among groups. (Examples include deconstructionism, poststructuralism, postmodernism, and critical theory.)\n\n\nCall-out culture requires an easy way to reach an audience that can award status to people who shame or punish alleged offenders. This is one reason social media has been so transformative: there is always an audience eager to watch people being shamed, particularly when it is so easy for spectators to join in and pile on.\n\n\nLife in a call-out culture requires constant vigilance, fear, and self-censorship. Many in the audience may feel sympathy for the person being shamed but are afraid to speak up, yielding the false impression that the audience is unanimous in its condemnation.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe human mind evolved for living in tribes that engaged in frequent (and often violent) conflict; our modern-day minds readily divide the world into “us” and “them,” even on trivial or arbitrary criteria, as Henri Tajfel’s psychological experiments demonstrated.\n\n\nIdentity politics takes many forms. Some forms, such as that practiced by Martin Luther King, Jr., and Pauli Murray, can be called common-humanity identity politics, because its practitioners humanize their opponents and appeal to their humanity while also applying political pressure in other ways.\n\n\nCommon-enemy identity politics, on the other hand, tries to unite a coalition using the psychology embedded in the Bedouin proverb “I against my brothers. I and my brothers against my cousins. I and my brothers and my cousins against the world.” It is used on the far right as well as the far left.\n\n\nIntersectionality is a popular intellectual framework on campuses today; certain versions of it teach students to see multiple axes of privilege and oppression that intersect. While there are merits to the theory, the way it is interpreted and practiced on campus can sometimes amplify tribal thinking and encourage students to endorse the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.\n\n\nCommon-enemy identity politics, when combined with microaggression theory, produces a call-out culture in which almost anything one says or does could result in a public shaming. This can engender a sense of “walking on eggshells,” and it teaches students habits of self-censorship. Call-out cultures are detrimental to students’ education and bad for their mental health. Call-out cultures and us-versus-them thinking are incompatible with the educational and research missions of universities, which require free inquiry, dissent, evidence-based argument, and intellectual honesty.\n\n\n## PART II Bad Ideas in Action\n\n\n### CHAPTER 4 Intimidation and Violence\n\n\nThis is another example of concept creep. In just the last few years, the word “violence” has expanded on campus and in some radical political communities beyond campus to cover a multitude of nonviolent actions, including speech that this political faction claims will have a negative impact on members of protected identity groups. Outside of cultures of safetyism, the word “violence” refers to physical violence. The word is sometimes used metaphorically (as in “I violently disagree”), but few of us, including those who claim that speech is violence, have any difficulty understanding the statement “We should reduce incarceration for nonviolent offenses.” However, now that some students, professors, and activists are labeling their opponents’ words as violence, they give themselves permission to engage in ideologically motivated physical violence.\n**Tags:** favorite\n\n\nThis sentence includes __fortune-telling__, as the students predict what Mac Donald would say. It also includes a rhetorical flourish that became common in 2017: the assertion that a speaker will “deny” people from certain identity groups “the right to exist.”60 This thinking is a form of catastrophizing, in that it inflates the horrors of a speaker’s words far beyond what the speaker might actually say.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nWe understand why so many students embraced more active and confrontational forms of protest. But because their activism is often based on an embrace of the Great Untruths and a tendency to attack potential allies, and because aggressive protests are often exactly what right-wing provocateurs are hoping to provoke, we believe that many student activists are harming themselves as well as their causes.\n\n\nThe more ways your identity can be threatened by casual daily interactions, the more valuable it will be to cultivate the Stoic (and Buddhist, and CBT) ability to not be emotionally reactive, to not let others control your mind and your cortisol levels.\n**Tags:** favorite, health\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe “Milo Riot” at UC Berkeley on February 1, 2017, marked a major shift in campus protests. Violence was used successfully to stop a speaker; people were injured, and there were (as far as we can tell) no costs to those who were violent. Some students later justified the violence as a legitimate form of “self-defense” to prevent speech that they said was violent.\n\n\nHardly any students say that they themselves would use violence to shut down a speech, but two surveys conducted in late 2017 found that substantial minorities of students (20% in one survey and 30% in the other) said it was sometimes “acceptable” for other students to use violence to prevent a speaker from speaking on campus.\n\n\nThe “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a white nationalist killed a peaceful counterprotester and injured others, further raised tensions on campus, especially as provocations from far-right groups increased in the months afterward.\n\n\nIn the fall of 2017, the number of efforts to shut down speakers reached a record level.\n\n\nIn 2017, the idea that speech can be violence (even when it does not involve threats, harassment, or calls for violence) seemed to spread, assisted by the tendency in some circles to focus only on perceived impact, not on intent. Words that give rise to stress or fear for members of some groups are now often regarded as a form of violence.\n\n\nSpeech is not violence. Treating it as such is an interpretive choice, and it is a choice that increases pain and suffering while preventing other, more effective responses, including the Stoic response (cultivating nonreactivity) and the antifragile response suggested by Van Jones: “Put on some boots, and learn how to deal with adversity.”\n\n\n### CHAPTER 5 Witch Hunts\n\n\nDurkheim saw groups and communities as being in some ways like organisms—social entities that have a chronic need to enhance their internal cohesion and their shared sense of moral order.\n\n\nBergesen notes that there are three features common to most political witch hunts: they arise very quickly, they involve charges of crimes against the collective, and the offenses that lead to charges are often trivial or fabricated.\n\n\nTo Bergesen’s list we’ll add a fourth feature, which necessarily follows from the first three: Fear of defending the accused: When a public accusation is made, many friends and bystanders know that the victim is innocent, but they are afraid to say anything. Anyone who comes to the defense of the accused is obstructing the enactment of a collective ritual. Siding with the accused is truly an offense against the group, and it will be treated as such.\n\n\nOne of the most brilliant features of universities is that, when they are working properly, they are communities of scholars who cancel out one another’s confirmation biases. Even if professors often cannot see the flaws in their own arguments, other professors and students do them the favor of finding such flaws. The community of scholars then judges which ideas survive the debate. We can call this process __institutionalized disconfirmation__. The institution (the academy as a whole, or a discipline, such as political science) guarantees that every statement offered as a research finding—and certainly every peer-reviewed article—has survived a process of challenge and vetting.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nOne of the strongest personality correlates of left-wing politics is the trait of openness to experience, a trait that describes people who crave new ideas and experiences and who tend to be interested in changing traditional arrangements.\n\n\nSocial conservatives tend to be lower on openness to experience and higher on conscientiousness—they prefer things to be orderly and predictable, they are more likely to show up on time for meetings, and they are more likely to see the value of traditional arrangements.\n\n\nPolitically homogeneous communities are more susceptible to witch hunts, particularly when they feel threatened from outside.\n\n\nHumans are tribal creatures who readily form groups to compete with other groups (as we saw in chapter 3). Sociologist Emile Durkheim’s work illuminates the way those groups engage in rituals—including the collective punishment of deviance—to enhance their cohesion and solidarity.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nCohesive and morally homogeneous groups are prone to witch hunts, particularly when they experience a threat, whether from outside or from within.\n\n\nWitch hunts generally have four properties: they seem to come out of nowhere; they involve charges of crimes against the collective; the offenses that lead to those charges are often trivial or fabricated; and people who know that the accused is innocent keep quiet, or in extreme cases, they join the mob.\n\n\nSome of the most puzzling campus events and trends since 2015 match the profile of a witch hunt. The campus protests at Yale, Claremont McKenna, and Evergreen all began as reactions to politely worded emails, and all led to demands that the authors of the emails be fired. (We repeat that the concerns that provide the context for a witch hunt may be valid, but in a witch hunt, the attendant fears are channeled in unjust and destructive ways.)\n\n\nThe new trend in 2017 for professors to join open letters denouncing their colleagues and demanding the retraction or condemnation of their work (as happened to Rebecca Tuvel, Amy Wax, and others) also fits this pattern. In all of these cases, colleagues of the accused were afraid to publicly stand up and defend them.\n\nViewpoint diversity reduces a community’s susceptibility to witch hunts. One of the most important kinds of viewpoint diversity, diversity of political thought, has declined substantially among both professors and students at American universities since the 1990s. These declines, combined with the rapidly escalating political polarization of the United States (which is our focus in the next chapter), may be part of the reason why the new culture of safetyism has spread so rapidly since its emergence around 2013.\n\n\n## PART III How Did We Get Here?\n\n\n### CHAPTER 6 The Polarization Cycle\n\n\nWhat is going on? There is no simple answer. In Part III, we present six interacting explanatory threads: rising political polarization and cross-party animosity; rising levels of teen anxiety and depression; changes in parenting practices; the decline of free play; the growth of campus bureaucracy; and a rising passion for justice in response to major national events, combined with changing ideas about what justice requires.\n\n\nBefore we present these threads, however, we must make two points explicitly and emphatically. The first point is that there are different threads for different people. Part of the complexity of our story is that not all of the threads have influenced each person and group on campus equally. ... The second point is that this is a book about good intentions gone awry. In all of the six chapters in this part of the book, you’ll read about people primarily acting from good or noble motivations. In most cases, the motive is to help or protect children or people seen as vulnerable or victimized. But as we all know, the road to hell can be paved with good intentions. Our goal in Part III is not to blame; it is to understand. Only by identifying and analyzing all six explanatory threads can we begin to talk about possible solutions,\n\n\nif we step back and look at American universities as complex institutions nested within a larger society that has been growing steadily more divided, angry, and polarized, we begin to see the left and the right locked into a game of mutual provocation and reciprocal outrage that is an essential piece of the puzzle we are trying to solve in this book.\n\n\nIssue Polarization FIGURE 6.1. The distance between Republicans and Democrats, on a set of 10 policy questions, has grown very large since 2004. Differences by race, gender, education, and age have not changed much since 1994. (Source: Pew Research Center.)\n\n\nAffective Polarization FIGURE 6.2. Affective partisan polarization. Americans’ feelings toward their own party have barely changed since the 1970s, but Americans have become increasingly “cold” or hostile toward the other party since the 1990s. (Source: American National Election Study,6 plotted by Iyengar and Krupenkin, 2018.)\n\n\nFrom the 1940s to around 1980, American politics was about as centrist and bipartisan as it has ever been.\n\n\nThese four trends, plus many more, have combined to produce a very unfortunate change in the dynamics of American politics, which political scientists call negative partisanship. In a recent review of data on __“affective polarization”__ (the degree to which members of each party feel negatively toward the other party), Iyengar and Krupenkin summarize the change like this:\n\nPrior to the era of polarization, ingroup favoritism, that is, partisans’ enthusiasm for their party or candidate, was the driving force behind political participation. More recently, however, it is hostility toward the out-party that makes people more inclined to participate. In other words, Americans are now motivated to leave their couches to take part in political action not by love for their party’s candidate but by hatred of the other party’s candidate. Negative partisanship means that American politics is driven less by hope and more by the Untruth of Us Versus Them. “They” must be stopped, at all costs.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nAmericans are now easily exploitable, and a large network of profit-driven media sites, political entrepreneurs, and foreign intelligence agencies are taking advantage of this vulnerability.\n\n\nThe vulnerability comes with an unfortunate asymmetry: the faculty and students at universities have shifted to the left since the 1990s, as we showed in the last chapter, while the “outrage industry” of talk radio, cable news networks, and conspiracy websites is more developed and effective on the right.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe United States has experienced a steady increase in at least one form of polarization since the 1980s: affective (or emotional) polarization, which means that people who identify with either of the two main political parties increasingly hate and fear the other party and the people in it. This is our first of six explanatory threads that will help us understand what has been changing on campus.\n\n\nAffective polarization in the United States is roughly symmetrical, but as university students and faculty have shifted leftward during a time of rising cross-party hatred, universities have begun to receive less trust and more hostility from some conservatives and right-leaning organizations.\n\n\nBeginning in 2016, the number of high-profile cases of professors being hounded or harassed from the right for something they said in an interview or on social media began to increase.\n\n\nRising political polarization, accompanied by increases in racial and political provocation from the right, usually directed from off-campus to on-campus targets, is an essential part of the story of why behavior is changing on campus, particularly since 2016.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 7 Anxiety and Depression\n\n\nIn the new discussions about safe spaces, trigger warnings, microaggressions, and speech as violence, students often employed arguments and justifications that seemed to come right out of the CBT training manual.\n\n\nTwenge finds that there are just two activities that are significantly correlated with depression and other suicide-related outcomes (such as considering suicide, making a plan, or making an actual attempt):\n\nelectronic device use (such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer) and watching TV.\n\nOn the other hand, there are five activities that have inverse relationships with depression (meaning that kids who spend more hours per week on these activities show lower rates of depression):\n\nsports and other forms of exercise, attending religious services, reading books and other print media, in-person social interactions, and doing homework\n\n**Tags:** favorite, health\n\n\nThe second reason that social media may be harder on girls is that girls and boys are aggressive in different ways. Research by psychologist Nicki Crick shows that boys are more physically aggressive—more likely to shove and hit one another, and they show a greater interest in stories and movies about physical aggression. Girls, in contrast, are more “relationally” aggressive; they try to hurt their rivals’ relationships, reputations, and social status—for example, by using social media to make sure other girls know who is intentionally being left out.33 When you add it all up, there’s no overall sex difference in total aggression, but there’s a large and consistent sex difference in the preferred ways of harming others. (At least, that was Crick’s finding in the 1990s, before the birth of social media.) Plus, if boys’ aggression is generally delivered in person, then the targets of boys’ aggression can escape from it when they go home. On social media, girls can never escape.\n\n\nSafetyism also inflicts collateral damage on the university’s culture of free inquiry, because it teaches students to see words as violence and to interpret ideas and speakers as safe versus dangerous, rather than merely as true versus false. That way of thinking about words is likely to promote the intensification of a call-out culture, which, of course, gives students one more reason to be anxious.\n\n\nSo we don’t want to create a moral panic and frighten parents into banning all devices until their kids turn twenty-one. These are complicated issues, and much more research is needed. In the meantime, as we’ll say in chapter 12, there is enough evidence to support placing time limits on device use (perhaps two hours a day for adolescents, less for younger kids) while limiting or prohibiting the use of platforms that amplify social comparison rather than social connection.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe national rise in adolescent anxiety and depression that began around 2011 is our second explanatory thread.\n\n\nThe generation born between 1995 and 2012, called iGen (or sometimes Gen Z), is very different from the Millennials, the generation that preceded it. According to Jean Twenge, an expert in the study of generational differences, one difference is that iGen is growing up more slowly. On average, eighteen-year-olds today have spent less time unsupervised and have hit fewer developmental milestones on the path to autonomy (such as getting a job or a driver’s license), compared with eighteen-year-olds in previous generations.\n\n\nA second difference is that iGen has far higher rates of anxiety and depression. The increases for girls and young women are generally much larger than for boys and young men. The increases do not just reflect changing definitions or standards; they show up in rising hospital admission rates of self-harm and in rising suicide rates. The suicide rate of adolescent boys is still higher than that of girls, but the suicide rate of adolescent girls has doubled since 2007.\n\n\nAccording to Twenge, the primary cause of the increase in mental illness is frequent use of smartphones and other electronic devices. Less than two hours a day seems to have no deleterious effects, but adolescents who spend several hours a day interacting with screens, particularly if they start in their early teen years or younger, have worse mental health outcomes than do adolescents who use these devices less and who spend more time in face-to-face social interaction.\n\n\nGirls may be suffering more than boys because they are more adversely affected by social comparisons (especially based on digitally enhanced beauty), by signals that they are being left out, and by relational aggression, all of which became easier to enact and harder to escape when adolescents acquired smartphones and social media.\n\n\niGen’s arrival at college coincides exactly with the arrival and intensification of the culture of safetyism from 2013 to 2017. Members of iGen may be especially attracted to the overprotection offered by the culture of safetyism on many campuses because of students’ higher levels of anxiety and depression. Both depression and anxiety cause changes in cognition, including a tendency to see the world as more dangerous and hostile than it really is.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 8 Paranoid Parenting\n\n\nWhen you combine the giant crime wave that began in the 1960s with the rapid spread of cable TV in the 1980s, including news channels that offered round-the-clock coverage of missing-child cases, you can see why American parents grew fearful and defensive by the 1990s. The crime wave ended rather abruptly in the early 1990s, when rates of nearly all crimes began to plummet all over the United States. In 2013, for example, the murder rate dropped to the same level it had been at sixty years earlier. Nevertheless, the fear of crime did not diminish along with the crime rate, and the new habits of fearful parenting seem to have become new national norms. American parenting is now wildly out of sync with the actual risk that strangers pose to children.\n\n\nThe lesson we draw from this brief review of research on social class and parenting is that although kids are naturally antifragile, there are two very different ways to damage their development. One is to neglect and underprotect them, exposing them early to severe and chronic adversity. This has happened to some of today’s college students, particularly those from working-class or poor families. The other is to overmonitor and overprotect them, denying them the thousands of small challenges, risks, and adversities that they need to face on their own in order to become strong and resilient adults.\n\n\nParanoid parenting is a powerful way to teach kids all three of the Great Untruths.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nParanoid parenting is our third explanatory thread.\n\n\nWhen we overprotect children, we harm them. Children are naturally antifragile, so overprotection makes them weaker and less resilient later on.\n\n\nChildren today have far more restricted childhoods, on average, than those enjoyed by their parents, who grew up in far more dangerous times and yet had many more opportunities to develop their intrinsic antifragility. Compared with previous generations, younger Millennials and especially members of iGen (born in and after 1995) have been deprived of unsupervised time for play and exploration. They have missed out on many of the challenges, negative experiences, and minor risks that help children develop into strong, competent, and independent adults (as we’ll show in the next chapter).\n\n\nChildren in the United States and other prosperous countries are safer today than at any other point in history. Yet for a variety of historical reasons, fear of abduction is still very high among American parents, many of whom have come to believe that children should never be without adult supervision. When children are repeatedly led to believe that the world is dangerous and that they cannot face it alone, we should not be surprised if many of them believe it.\n\n\nHelicopter parenting combined with laws and social norms that make it hard to give kids unsupervised time may be having a negative impact on the mental health and resilience of young people today.\n\n\nThere are large social class differences in parenting styles. Families in the middle class (and above) tend to use a style that sociologist Annette Lareau calls “concerted cultivation,” in contrast to the “natural growth parenting” used by families in the working class (and below). Some college students from wealthier families may have been rendered more fragile from overparenting and oversupervision. College students from poorer backgrounds are exposed to a very different set of risks, including potential exposure to chronic, severe adversity, which is especially detrimental to resilience when children lack caring relationships with adults who can buffer stress and help them turn adversity into growth.\n\n\nParanoid parenting prepares today’s children to embrace the three Great Untruths, which means that when they go to college, they are psychologically primed to join a culture of safetyism.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 9 The Decline of Play\n\n\nIn species that are predators, such as wolves, their pups seem to prefer to be the chasers. In species that are prey, such as rats, the pups prefer to be chased. Our primate ancestors were both prey and predator, but they were prey for much longer. That may be why human children particularly enjoy practicing their fleeing and hiding skills.\n\n\nA key concept from developmental biology is __“experience-expectant development.”__\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nPeter Gray, a leading researcher of play, defines __“free play”__ as “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nWhen asked to select reasons to explain why their children didn’t spend more time on outdoor play, 82% of the mothers chose “safety concerns,” including the fear of crime. But there’s a second reason, a second fear that haunts American parents and children—particularly those in the middle class and above—far more than it did in the late twentieth century: the college admissions process.\n\n\nBut “grit is often misunderstood as perseverance without passion, and that’s tragic,” psychology professor Angela Duckworth, author of the book Grit, told us. “Perseverance without passion is mere drudgery.” She wants young people to “devote themselves to pursuits that are intrinsically fulfilling.”\n\n\nOf greatest importance in free play is that it is always voluntary; anyone can quit at any time and disrupt the activity, so children must pay close attention to the needs and concerns of others if they want to keep the game going. They must work out conflicts over fairness on their own; no adult can be called upon to side with one child against another.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe decline of unsupervised free play is our fourth explanatory thread. Children, like other mammals, need free play in order to finish the intricate wiring process of neural development. Children deprived of free play are likely to be less competent—physically and socially—as adults. They are likely to be less tolerant of risk, and more prone to anxiety disorders.\n\n\nFree play, according to Peter Gray, is “activity that is freely chosen and directed by the participants and undertaken for its own sake, not consciously pursued to achieve ends that are distinct from the activity itself.” This is the kind of play that play experts say is most valuable for children, yet it is also the kind of play that has declined most sharply in the lives of American children.\n\n\nThe decline in free play was likely driven by several factors, including an unrealistic fear of strangers and kidnapping (since the 1980s); the rising competitiveness for admission to top universities (over many decades); a rising emphasis on testing, test preparation, and homework; and a corresponding deemphasis on physical and social skills (since the early 2000s).\n\n\nThe rising availability of smartphones and social media interacted with these other trends, and the combination has greatly changed the way American children spend their time and the kinds of physical and social experiences that guide the intricate wiring process of neural development.\n\n\nFree play helps children develop the skills of cooperation and dispute resolution that are closely related to the “art of association” upon which democracies depend. When citizens are not skilled in this art, they are less able to work out the ordinary conflicts of daily life. They will more frequently call for authorities to apply coercive force to their opponents. They will be more likely to welcome the bureaucracy of safetyism.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 10 The Bureaucracy of Safetyism\n\n\nIn 1963, Clark Kerr, the president of the University of California system, called the resulting structure the __“multiversity.”__ In a multiversity, different departments and power structures within a university pursue different goals in parallel—for example, research, education, fundraising, branding, and legal compliance.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nA less immediately obvious downside is that goals other than academic excellence begin to take priority as universities come to resemble large corporations—a trend often bemoaned as __“corporatization.”__\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nEric Adler, a classics professor at the University of Maryland, distilled the argument in a 2018 Washington Post article. “The fundamental cause [of campus intolerance],” he suggests, “isn’t students’ extreme leftism or any other political ideology” but “a market-driven decision by universities, made decades ago, to treat students as consumers\n\n\nEven at public universities, 18-year-olds are purchasing what is essentially a luxury product. Is it any wonder they feel entitled to control the experience?\n\n\nOverreaction and overregulation are usually the work of people within bureaucratic structures who have developed a mindset commonly known as CYA (Cover Your Ass). They know they can be held responsible for any problem that arises on their watch, especially if they took no action to prevent it, so they often adopt a defensive stance.\n\n\nYoung people have come to believe that danger lurks everywhere, even in the classroom, and even in private conversations.\n\n\nOf course, there should be an easy way to report cases of true harassment and employment discrimination; such actions are immoral and unlawful. But bias alone is not harassment or discrimination.\n\n\nIn 2013, the Departments of Education and Justice issued a sweeping new definition of harassment: any “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” including “verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct.” This definition was not limited to speech that would be offensive to a reasonable person, nor did it require that the alleged target actually be offended—both requirements of traditional harassment claims. By eliminating the reasonable-person standard, harassment was left to be defined by the self-reported subjective experience of every member of the university community. It was, in effect, emotional reasoning turned into a federal regulation.\n\n\nIn a prescient essay in 2014, two sociologists—Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning—explained where this new culture of vulnerability came from and how administrative actions helped it to grow. They called it -__“victimhood culture,”__ and they interpreted it as a new moral order that was in conflict with the older “dignity culture,” which is still dominant in most parts of the United States and other Western democracies.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nThis is in contrast to the older “honor cultures,” in which men were so obsessed with guarding their reputations that they were expected to react violently to minor insults made against them or those close to them—perhaps with a challenge to a duel.\n\n\nThey defined a victimhood culture as having three distinct attributes: First, “individuals and groups display high sensitivity to slight”; second, they “have a tendency to handle conflicts through complaints to third parties”; and third, they “seek to cultivate an image of being victims who deserve assistance.”\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nThe growth of campus bureaucracy and the expansion of its protective mission is our fifth explanatory thread.\n\n\nAdministrators generally have good intentions; they are trying to protect the university and its students. But good intentions can sometimes lead to policies that are bad for students.\n\n\nIn response to a variety of factors, including federal mandates and the risk of lawsuits, the number of campus administrators has grown more rapidly than the number of professors, and professors have gradually come to play a smaller role in the administration of universities. The result has been a trend toward “corporatization.”\n\n\nAt the same time, market pressures, along with an increasingly consumerist mentality about higher education, have encouraged universities to compete on the basis of the amenities they offer, leading them to think of students as customers whom they must please.\n\n\nCampus administrators must juggle many responsibilities and protect the university from many kinds of liabilities, so they tend to adopt a “better safe than sorry” (or “CYA”) approach to issuing new regulations. The proliferation of regulations over time conveys a sense of imminent danger even when there is little or no real threat. In this way, administrators model multiple cognitive distortions, promote the Untruth of Fragility, and contribute to the culture of safetyism.\n\n\nSome of the regulations promulgated by administrators restrict freedom of speech, often with highly subjective definitions of key concepts. These rules contribute to an attitude on campus that chills speech, in part by suggesting that freedom of speech can or should be restricted because of some students’ emotional discomfort. This teaches catastrophizing and mind reading (among other cognitive distortions) and promotes the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning.\n\n\nOne recent administrative innovation is the creation of “Bias Response Lines” and “Bias Response Teams,” which make it easy for members of a campus community to report one another anonymously for “bias.” This “feel something, say something” approach is likely to erode trust within a community. It may also make professors less willing to try innovative or provocative teaching methods; they, too, may develop a CYA approach. More generally, efforts to protect students by creating bureaucratic means of resolving problems and conflicts can have the unintended consequence of fostering moral dependence, which may reduce students’ ability to resolve conflicts independently both during and after college.\n\n\n### CHAPTER 11 The Quest for Justice\n\n\nthere is a window of higher impressionability running from about age fourteen to twenty-four, with its peak right around age eighteen. Political events—or perhaps the overall zeitgeist as people perceive it—are more likely to “stick” during that period than outside that age range.\n\n\nToday’s college students have lived through extraordinary times, and, as a result, many of them have developed an extraordinary passion for social justice. That passion, which drives some of the changes we are seeing on college campuses in recent years, is our sixth explanatory thread.\n\n\n#### Intuitive Justice\n\n\n__Intuitive justice__ is the combination of distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nProportionality is the heart of __“equity theory,”__ the major theory of distributive justice in social psychology. Its core assertion is that when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants, people perceive that to be equitable, or fair.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nAn early study testing equity theory found that when people were led to believe that they were being overpaid for a job, they worked harder in order to deserve the pay—to get their ratio back into line.\n\n\npeople are much more willing to accept a decision or action, even one that goes against themselves, when they perceive that the process that led to the decision was fair.\n\n\nThere are two basic concerns that people bring to their judgments of procedural justice. The first is how the decision is being made. ... The second basic concern is how a person is being treated along the way,\n\n\nIf you want to motivate people to support a new policy or join a movement in the name of justice, you need to activate in them a clear perception, or intuition, that someone didn’t get what he or she deserved (distributive injustice) or that someone was a victim of an unfair process (procedural injustice).\n\n\n#### Proportional-Procedural Social Justice\n\n\nHere’s a definition of __social justice__ that accords with intuitive notions of justice, from the National Association of Social Workers: “Social justice is the view that everyone deserves equal economic, political and social rights and opportunities. Social workers aim to open the doors of access and opportunity for everyone, particularly those in greatest need.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nUsing that definition of social justice, we’ll define __proportional-procedural social justice__ as the effort to find and fix cases where distributive or procedural justice is denied to people because they were born into poverty or belong to a socially disadvantaged category.\n**Tags:** definition\n\n\nIn our account, proportional-procedural social justice falls entirely within the larger domain of intuitive justice. That doesn’t mean we should discard the term “social justice.” Some injustices based on race, gender, or other factors (and their intersections) are obvious, but others are subtle, and people who do not experience them can be unaware of them (as Kimberlé Crenshaw noted). It is useful to have specialists within the domain of justice research who focus on this subset of injustices. Furthermore, when such injustices are pointed out, members of the majority group are often motivated to ignore or deny them.\n\n\n#### Equal-Outcomes Social Justice\n\n\nWhen the federal government pressures universities to achieve equal outcomes in the face of unequal inputs, administrators do what they can to protect the institution. That might require them to violate procedural justice, distributive justice, and honesty along the way.\n\n\nMost people want individuals to be treated well, and they recoil from cases where individuals are treated unfairly in order to bring about some kind of group-level equality. This is why quotas generally produce such strong backlash: they mandate a violation of procedural justice (people are treated differently based on their race, sex, or some other factor) and distributive justice (rewards are not proportional to inputs) to achieve a specific end-state of equal outcomes.\n\n\nWhen you see a situation in which some groups are underrepresented, it is an invitation to investigate and find out whether there are obstacles, a hostile climate, or systemic factors that have a disparate impact on members of those groups.\n\n\n#### Correlation Does Not Imply Causation\n\n\nIf professors and students are hesitant to raise alternative explanations for outcome gaps, then theories about those gaps may harden into orthodoxy. Ideas may be accepted not because they are true but because the politically dominant group wants them to be true in order to promote its preferred narrative and preferred set of remedies.\n\n\nStudents today are fighting for many causes that we believe are noble, too, including ending racial injustices in the legal system and in encounters with the police; providing equal educational and other opportunities for everyone, regardless of circumstances at birth; and extinguishing cultural habits that encourage or enable sexual harassment and gender inequalities. On these and many other issues, we think student protesters are on the “right side of history,” and we support their goals. But if activists embrace the equal-outcomes form of social justice—if they interpret all deviations from population norms as evidence of systemic bias—then they will get drawn into endless and counterproductive campaigns, even against people who share their goals. Along the way, they will reinforce the bad mental habits that we have described throughout the book.\n\n\nAs long as activists keep their eyes on the two components of intuitive justice that all of us carry in our minds—distributive and procedural—they will apply their efforts where they are likely to do the most good, and they will win more widespread support along the way.\n\n\n#### In Sum\n\n\nPeople’s ordinary, everyday, intuitive notions of justice include two major types: distributive justice (the perception that people are getting what is deserved) and procedural justice (the perception that the process by which things are distributed and rules are enforced is fair and trustworthy).\n\n\nThe most common way that people think about distributive justice is captured by equity theory, which states that things are perceived to be fair when the ratio of outcomes to inputs is equal for all participants.\n\n\nProcedural justice is about how decisions are being made, and is also about how people are treated along the way, as procedures unfold.\n\n\nSocial justice is a central concept in campus life today, and it takes a variety of forms. When social justice efforts are fully consistent with both distributive and procedural justice, we call it proportional-procedural social justice. Such efforts generally aim to remove barriers to equality of opportunity and also to ensure that everyone is treated with dignity.\n\n\nBut when social justice efforts aim to achieve equality of outcomes by group, and when social justice activists are willing to violate distributive or procedural fairness for some individuals along the way, these efforts violate many people’s sense of intuitive justice. We call this equal-outcomes social justice.\n\n\nCorrelation does not imply causation. Yet in many discussions in universities these days, the correlation of a demographic trait or identity group membership with an outcome gap is taken as evidence that discrimination (structural or individual) caused the outcome gap. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn’t, but if people can’t raise alternative possible causal explanations without eliciting negative consequences, then the community is unlikely to arrive at an accurate understanding of the problem. And without understanding the true nature of a problem, there is little chance of solving it.\n\n\n## PART IV Wising Up\n\n\n### CHAPTER 12 Wiser Kids\n\n\nWe therefore offer these suggestions with the caveat that any effort to change one part of children’s lives can produce unexpected effects in some other part. More research is needed, but we think these suggestions are likely to be helpful.\n\n\n#### 1. Prepare the Child for the Road, Not the Road for the Child\n\n\nIt was foolish to think one could clear the road for one’s child before the internet. Now it is delusional.\n\n\nIn that spirit, here are some specific suggestions for parents, teachers, and all who care for children:\n\n\nAssume that your kids are more capable this month than they were last month.\n\n\nLet your kids take more small risks,\n\n\nLearn about Lenore Skenazy’s Free-Range Kids movement, and incorporate her lessons into your family’s life.\n\n\nVisit LetGrow.org,\n\n\nEncourage your children to walk or ride bicycles to and from school\n\n\nHelp your kids find a community of kids in the neighborhood\n\n\nSend your children to an overnight summer camp in the woods\n\n\nEncourage your children to engage in a lot of “productive disagreement.”\n\n\nGrant offers the following four rules for productive disagreement:\n\n* Frame it as a debate, rather than a conflict.\n* Argue as if you’re right, but listen as if you’re wrong (and be willing to change your mind).\n* Make the most respectful interpretation of the other person’s perspective.\n* Acknowledge where you agree with your critics and what you’ve learned from them.\n\n\n#### 2. Your Worst Enemy Cannot Harm You as Much as Your Own Thoughts, Unguarded\n\n\nTeach children the basics of CBT.\n\n\nTeach children mindfulness.\n\n\n#### 3. The Line Dividing Good and Evil Cuts Through the Heart of Every Human Being\n\n\nGive people the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\nPractice the virtue of “intellectual humility.”\n\n\nLook very carefully at how your school handles identity politics.\n\n\n#### 4. Help Schools to Oppose the Great Untruths\n\n\nHomework in the early grades should be minimal.\n\n\nGive more recess with less supervision.\n\n\nDiscourage the use of the word “safe” or “safety” for anything other than physical safety.\n\n\nHave a “no devices” policy.\n\n\nProtect or expand middle school recess.\n\n\nCultivate the intellectual virtues.\n\n\nTeach debate and offer debate club.\n\n\nAssign readings and coursework that promote reasoned discussion.\n\n\n#### 5. Limit and Refine Device Time\n\n\nPlace clear limits on device time.\n\n\nPay as much attention to what children are doing as you do to how much time they spend doing it.\n\n\nProtect your child’s sleep.\n\n\n#### 6. Support a New National Norm: Service or Work Before College\n\n\n### CHAPTER 13 Wiser Universities\n\n\n#### 1. Entwine Your Identity With Freedom of Inquiry\n\n\nEndorse the Chicago Statement.\n\n\nEstablish a practice of not responding to public outrage.\n\n\nDo not allow the “heckler’s veto.”\n\n\n#### 2. Pick the Best Mix of People for the Mission\n\n\nAdmit more students who are older and can show evidence of their ability to live independently.\n\n\nAdmit more students who have attended schools that teach the “intellectual virtues.”\n\n\nInclude viewpoint diversity in diversity policies.\n\n\n#### 3. Orient and Educate for Productive Disagreement\n\n\nExplicitly reject the Untruth of Fragility: What doesn’t kill you makes you weaker.\n\n\nExplicitly reject the Untruth of Emotional Reasoning: Always trust your feelings.\n\n\nExplicitly reject the Untruth of Us Versus Them: Life is a battle between good people and evil people.\n\n\n#### 4. Draw a Larger Circle Around the Community\n\n\nFoster school spirit.\n\n\nProtect physical safety.\n\n\nHost civil, cross-partisan events for students.\n\n\nFive questions alumni, parents, college counselors, and prospective students should ask universities: What steps do you take (if any) to teach incoming students about academic freedom and free inquiry before they take their first classes? How would you handle a demand that a professor be fired because of an opinion he or she expressed in an article or interview, which other people found deeply offensive? What would your institution do if a controversial speaker were scheduled to speak, and large protests that included credible threats of violence were planned? How is your institution responding to the increase in students who suffer from anxiety and depression? What does your university do to foster a sense of shared identity?\n\n\nLook for answers that indicate that the institution has a high tolerance for vigorous disagreement but no tolerance for violence or intimidation. Look for answers that indicate a presumption that students are antifragile, combined with the recognition that many students today need support as they work toward emotional growth. Look for answers that indicate that the institution tries to draw an encompassing circle around its members, within which differences can more productively be explored.\n\n\n### CONCLUSION Wiser Societies\n\n\n## APPENDIX 1 How to Do CBT\n\n\nThe beauty of CBT is how easy it is to learn: All you need is pen and paper (or a laptop, or a device with an app that lets you take notes). The specific details for practicing CBT differ from book to book and therapist to therapist, but the basic process is something like this:\n\n* When you are feeling anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed, take a moment to write down what you are feeling.\n* Write down your level of distress. (For example, you could score it on a scale of 1 to 100.)\n* Write down what happened and what your automatic thoughts were when you felt the pang of anxiety or despair. (For example, “Someone I was interested in canceled our date. I said to myself, ‘This always happens. No one will ever want to go out with me. I’m a total loser.’”)\n* Look at the categories of distorted automatic thoughts below, and ask yourself: Is this thought a cognitive distortion? Write down the cognitive distortions you notice. (For example, looking at the automatic thoughts in number 3 above, you might write, “personalizing, overgeneralizing, labeling, and catastrophizing.”)\n* Look at the evidence for and against your thought.\n* Ask yourself what someone might say who disagreed with you. Is there any merit in that opinion?\n* Consider again what happened, and reevaluate the situation without the cognitive distortions.\n* Write down your new thoughts and feelings. (For example, “I am sad and disappointed that a date I was excited about got canceled.”)\n* Write down again, using the same scale as before, how anxious, depressed, or otherwise distressed you feel. Chances are the number will be lower—perhaps a lot lower.\n\n\nCategories of Distorted Automatic Thoughts\n\n* MIND READING: You assume that you know what people think without having sufficient evidence of their thoughts. “He thinks I’m a loser.”\n* FORTUNE-TELLING: You predict the future negatively: Things will get worse, or there is danger ahead. “I’ll fail that exam,” or “I won’t get the job.”\n* CATASTROPHIZING: You believe that what has happened or will happen will be so awful and unbearable that you won’t be able to stand it. “It would be terrible if I failed.”\n* LABELING: You assign global negative traits to yourself and others. “I’m undesirable,” or “He’s a rotten person.”\n* DISCOUNTING POSITIVES: You claim that the positive things you or others do are trivial. “That’s what wives are supposed to do—so it doesn’t count when she’s nice to me,” or “Those successes were easy, so they don’t matter.”\n* NEGATIVE FILTERING: You focus almost exclusively on the negatives and seldom notice the positives. “Look at all of the people who don’t like me.” *\nOVERGENERALIZING: You perceive a global pattern of negatives on the basis of a single incident. “This generally happens to me. I seem to fail at a lot of things.”\n* DICHOTOMOUS THINKING: You view events or people in all-or-nothing terms. “I get rejected by everyone,” or “It was a complete waste of time.”\n* SHOULDS: You interpret events in terms of how things should be, rather than simply focusing on what is. “I should do well. If I don’t, then I’m a failure.”\n* PERSONALIZING: You attribute a disproportionate amount of the blame to yourself for negative events, and you fail to see that certain events are also caused by others. “The marriage ended because I failed.”\n* BLAMING: You focus on the other person as the source of your negative feelings, and you refuse to take responsibility for changing yourself. “She’s to blame for the way I feel now,” or “My parents caused all my problems.”\n* UNFAIR COMPARISONS: You interpret events in terms of standards that are unrealistic—for example, you focus primarily on others who do better than you and find yourself inferior in the comparison. “She’s more successful than I am,” or “Others did better than I did on the test.”\n* REGRET ORIENTATION: You focus on the idea that you could have done better in the past, rather than on what you can do better now. “I could have had a better job if I had tried,” or “I shouldn’t have said that.”\n* WHAT IF?: You keep asking a series of questions about “what if” something happens, and you fail to be satisfied with any of the answers. “Yeah, but what if I get anxious?” or “What if I can’t catch my breath?”\n* EMOTIONAL REASONING: You let your feelings guide your interpretation of reality. “I feel depressed; therefore, my marriage is not working out.”\n* INABILITY TO DISCONFIRM: You reject any evidence or arguments that might contradict your negative thoughts. For example, when you have the thought “I’m unlovable,” you reject as irrelevant any evidence that people like you. Consequently, your thought cannot be refuted. “That’s not the real issue. There are deeper problems. There are other factors.\"\n* JUDGMENT FOCUS: You view yourself, others, and events in terms of evaluations as good–bad or superior–inferior, rather than simply describing, accepting, or understanding. You are continually measuring yourself and others according to arbitrary standards, and finding that you and others fall short. You are focused on the judgments of others as well as your own judgments of yourself. “I didn’t perform well in college,” or “If I take up tennis, I won’t do well,” or “Look how successful she is. I’m not successful.”\n\n\n## APPENDIX 2 The Chicago Statement on Principles of Free Expression\n\n\n",

				"title": "📚 Amusing Ourselves to Death",
				"content_html": "<p>📚Finished Reading: <em><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/read/\">Amusing Ourselves to Death</a></em> by Neil Postman</p>\n<p><strong>Highly Recommended</strong>. I read <em>Technopoly</em> previously and still found a lot of value in this.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h1 id=\"my-reading-highlights-and-notes\">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<p>His questions can be asked about all technologies and media. What happens to us when we become infatuated with and then seduced by them? Do they free us or imprison us? Do they improve or degrade democracy? Do they make our leaders more accountable or less so? Our system more transparent or less so? Do they make us better citizens or better consumers? Are the trade-offs worth it? If they’re not worth it, yet we still can’t stop ourselves from embracing the next new thing because that’s just how we’re wired, then what strategies can we devise to maintain control? Dignity? Meaning?</p>\n<p>This book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-i\">Part I.</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-the-medium-is-the-metaphor\">1. The Medium Is the Metaphor</h3>\n<p>Our politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.</p>\n<p>There is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality.</p>\n<p>We are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it.</p>\n<p>It is an argument that fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.</p>\n<p>For on television, discourse is conducted largely through visual imagery, which is to say that television gives us a conversation in images, not words. The emergence of the image-manager in the political arena and the concomitant decline of the speech writer attest to the fact that television demands a different kind of content from other media. You cannot do political philosophy on television. Its form works against the content.</p>\n<p>We attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation.</p>\n<p>the clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation.</p>\n<p>People like ourselves who are in the process of converting their culture from word-centered to image-centered might profit by reflecting on this Mosaic injunction.</p>\n<p>We know enough about language to understand that variations in the structures of languages will result in variations in what may be called “world view.” How people think about time and space, and about things and processes, will be greatly influenced by the grammatical features of their language.</p>\n<p>Each medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.</p>\n<p>person who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a book, television, or a watch.</p>\n<p>In Mumford’s great book Technics and Civilization, he shows how, beginning in the fourteenth century, the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it is clear that phonetic writing created a new conception of knowledge, as well as a new sense of intelligence, of audience and of posterity, all of which Plato recognized at an early stage in the development of texts.</p>\n<p>Writing freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist—all those who must hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading.</p>\n<p>what my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of electronics.</p>\n<p>We are told in school, quite correctly, that a metaphor suggests what a thing is like by comparing it to something else. And by the power of its suggestion, it so fixes a conception in our minds that we cannot imagine the one thing without the other:</p>\n<p>in every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself.</p>\n<p>Eyeglasses refuted the belief that anatomy is destiny by putting forward the idea that our bodies as well as our minds are improvable.</p>\n<p>And our languages are our media. Our media are our metaphors. Our metaphors create the content of our culture.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-media-as-epistemology\">2. Media as Epistemology</h3>\n<p>It is my intention in this book to show that a great media-metaphor shift has taken place in America, with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense.</p>\n<p>I raise no objection to television’s junk. The best things on television are its junk, and no one and nothing is seriously threatened by it.</p>\n<p>we do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by what it claims as significant.</p>\n<p>Therein is our problem, for television is at its most trivial and, therefore, most dangerous when its aspirations are high, when it presents itself as a carrier of important cultural conversations.</p>\n<p>Whatever the original and limited context of its use may have been, a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones. Because of the way it directs us to organize our minds and integrate our experience of the world, it imposes itself on our consciousness and social institutions in myriad forms. It sometimes has the power to become implicated in our concepts of piety, or goodness, or beauty. And it is always implicated in the ways we define and regulate our ideas of truth.</p>\n<p>For in a print-based courtroom, where law books, briefs, citations and other written materials define and organize the method of finding the truth, the oral tradition has lost much of its resonance—but not all of it. Testimony is expected to be given orally, on the assumption that the spoken, not the written, word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness. Indeed, in many courtrooms jurors are not permitted to take notes, nor are they given written copies of the judge’s explanation of the law. Jurors are expected to hear the truth, or its opposite, not to read it. Thus, we may say that there is a clash of resonances in our concept of legal truth.</p>\n<p>the written word is, by its nature, addressed to the world, not an individual.</p>\n<p>The written word endures, the spoken word disappears; and that is why writing is closer to the truth than speaking.</p>\n<p>the concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. Truth does not, and never has, come unadorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is not acknowledged, which is a way of saying that the “truth” is a kind of cultural prejudice. Each culture conceives of it as being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms that another culture may regard as trivial or irrelevant.</p>\n<p>“Seeing is believing” has always had a preeminent status as an epistemological axiom, but “saying is believing,” “reading is believing,” “counting is believing,” “deducing is believing,” and “feeling is believing” are others that have risen or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change.</p>\n<p>Since intelligence is primarily defined as one’s capacity to grasp the truth of things, it follows that what a culture means by intelligence is derived from the character of its important forms of communication.</p>\n<p>My argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of content—in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling.</p>\n<p>I am arguing that a television-based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape, not that it pollutes everything.</p>\n<p>I will try to demonstrate that as typography moves to the periphery of our culture and television takes its place at the center, the seriousness, clarity and, above all, value of public discourse dangerously declines.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-typographic-america\">3. Typographic America</h3>\n<p>The Dunkers came close here to formulating a commandment about religious discourse: Thou shalt not write down thy principles, still less print them, lest thou shall be entrapped by them for all time.</p>\n<p>the Lyceum Movement had as its purpose the diffusion of knowledge, the promotion of common schools, the creation of libraries and, especially, the establishment of lecture halls.</p>\n<p>The influence of the printed word in every arena of public discourse was insistent and powerful not merely because of the quantity of printed matter but because of its monopoly.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-the-typographic-mind\">4. The Typographic Mind</h3>\n<p>Is there any audience of Americans today who could endure seven hours of talk? or five? or three? Especially without pictures of any kind?</p>\n<p>Whenever language is the principal medium of communication—especially language controlled by the rigors of print—an idea, a fact, a claim is the inevitable result. The idea may be banal, the fact irrelevant, the claim false, but there is no escape from meaning when language is the instrument guiding one’s thought.</p>\n<p>As a consequence a language-centered discourse such as was characteristic of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America tends to be both content-laden and serious, all the more so when it takes its form from print.</p>\n<p>A written sentence calls upon its author to say something, upon its reader to know the import of what is said.</p>\n<p>The reader must come armed, in a serious state of intellectual readiness. This is not easy because he comes to the text alone. In reading, one’s responses are isolated, one’s intellect thrown back on its own resources. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community.</p>\n<p>In a print culture, writers make mistakes when they lie, contradict themselves, fail to support their generalizations, try to enforce illogical connections. In a print culture, readers make mistakes when they don’t notice, or even worse, don’t care.</p>\n<p>If we may take advertising to be the voice of commerce, then its history tells very clearly that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries those with products to sell took their customers to be not unlike Daniel Webster: they assumed that potential buyers were literate, rational, analytical.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the history of newspaper advertising in America may be considered, all by itself, as a metaphor of the descent of the typographic mind, beginning, as it does, with reason, and ending, as it does, with entertainment.</p>\n<p>Public figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory. It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers and scientists of that era. To think about those men was to think about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word. You may get some sense of how we are separated from this kind of consciousness by thinking about any of our recent presidents; or even preachers, lawyers and scientists who are or who have recently been public figures. Think of Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of a face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein’s case, a photograph of a face). Of words, almost nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture.</p>\n<p>For two centuries, America declared its intentions, expressed its ideology, designed its laws, sold its products, created its literature and addressed its deities with black squiggles on white paper.</p>\n<p>The name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition.</p>\n<p>Almost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response.</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-the-peek-a-boo-world\">5. The Peek-a-Boo World</h3>\n<p>Thoreau, as it turned out, was precisely correct. He grasped that the telegraph would create its own definition of discourse; that it would not only permit but insist upon a conversation between Maine and Texas; and that it would require the content of that conversation to be different from what Typographic Man was accustomed to.</p>\n<p>telegraphy gave a form of legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action, but may attach merely to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a “thing” that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.</p>\n<p>telegraphy made relevance irrelevant. The abundant flow of information had very little or nothing to do with those to whom it was addressed; that is, with any social or intellectual context in which their lives were embedded.</p>\n<p>How often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or provides insight into some problem you are required to solve?</p>\n<p>most of our daily news is inert, consisting of information that gives us something to talk about but cannot lead to any meaningful action. This fact is the principal legacy of the telegraph: By generating an abundance of irrelevant information, it dramatically altered what may be called the “information-action ratio.”\n<strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>You may get a sense of what this means by asking yourself another series of questions: What steps do you plan to take to reduce the conflict in the Middle East? Or the rates of inflation, crime and unemployment? What are your plans for preserving the environment or reducing the risk of nuclear war? What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, the CIA, affirmative action, and the monstrous treatment of the Baha’is in Iran? I shall take the liberty of answering for you: You plan to do nothing about them. You may, of course, cast a ballot for someone who claims to have some plans, as well as the power to act. But this you can do only once every two or four years by giving one hour of your time, hardly a satisfying means of expressing the broad range of opinions you hold.</p>\n<p>We may say then that the contribution of the telegraph to public discourse was to dignify irrelevance and amplify impotence.</p>\n<p>The principal strength of the telegraph was its capacity to move information, not collect it, explain it or analyze it. In this respect, telegraphy was the exact opposite of typography. Books, for example, are an excellent container for the accumulation, quiet scrutiny and organized analysis of information and ideas.</p>\n<p>“Knowing” the facts took on a new meaning, for it did not imply that one understood implications, background, or connections.</p>\n<p>In a peculiar way, the photograph was the perfect complement to the flood of telegraphic news-from-nowhere that threatened to submerge readers in a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces. For the photograph gave a concrete reality to the strange-sounding datelines, and attached faces to the unknown names. Thus it provided the illusion, at least, that “the news” had a connection to something within one’s sensory experience. It created an apparent context for the “news of the day.” And the “news of the day” created a context for the photograph.</p>\n<p>It may be of some interest to note, in this connection, that the crossword puzzle became a popular form of diversion in America at just that point when the telegraph and the photograph had achieved the transformation of news from functional information to decontextualized fact. This coincidence suggests that the new technologies had turned the age-old problem of information on its head: Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context; the cocktail party is another; the radio quiz shows of the 1930s and 1940s and the modern television game show are still others; and the ultimate, perhaps, is the wildly successful “Trivial Pursuit.” In one form or another, each of these supplies an answer to the question, “What am I to do with all these disconnected facts?” And in one form or another, the, answer is the same: Why not use them for diversion? for entertainment? to amuse yourself, in a game?</p>\n<p>the loss of the sense of the strange is a sign of adjustment, and the extent to which we have adjusted is a measure of the extent to which we have been changed.</p>\n<p>I will try to demonstrate by concrete example that television’s way of knowing is uncompromisingly hostile to typography’s way of knowing; that television’s conversations promote incoherence and triviality; that the phrase “serious television” is a contradiction in terms; and that television speaks in only one persistent voice—the voice of entertainment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-ii\">Part II.</h2>\n<h3 id=\"6-the-age-of-show-business\">6. The Age of Show Business</h3>\n<p>If television is a continuation of anything, it is of a tradition begun by the telegraph and photograph in the mid-nineteenth century, not by the printing press in the fifteenth.</p>\n<p>I must begin by making a distinction between a technology and a medium. We might say that a technology is to a medium as the brain is to the mind. Like the brain, a technology is a physical apparatus. Like the mind, a medium is a use to which a physical apparatus is put. A technology becomes a medium as it employs a particular symbolic code, as it finds its place in a particular social setting, as it insinuates itself into economic and political contexts. A technology, in other words, is merely a machine. A medium is the social and intellectual environment a machine creates.</p>\n<p>every technology has an inherent bias. It has within its physical form a predisposition toward being used in certain ways and not others.</p>\n<p>The average length of a shot on network television is only 3.5 seconds, so that the eye never rests, always has something new to see.\n<strong>Note:</strong> surely much shorter since this was written</p>\n<p>what I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience. Our television set keeps us in constant communion with the world, but it does so with a face whose smiling countenance is unalterable. The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue altogether.</p>\n<p>There is no conspiracy here, no lack of intelligence, only a straightforward recognition that “good television” has little to do with what is “good” about exposition or other forms of verbal communication but everything to do with what the pictorial images look like.</p>\n<p>almost all television programs are embedded in music, which helps to tell the audience what emotions are to be called forth.</p>\n<p>When a television show is in process, it is very nearly impermissible to say, “Let me think about that” or “I don’t know” or “What do you mean when you say . . . ?” or “From what sources does your information come?” This type of discourse not only slows down the tempo of the show but creates the impression of uncertainty or lack of finish.</p>\n<p>Thinking does not play well on television, a fact that television directors discovered long ago. There is not much to see in it. It is, in a phrase, not a performing art.</p>\n<p>The single most important fact about television is that people watch it, which is why it is called “television.” And what they watch, and like to watch, are moving pictures—millions of them, of short duration and dynamic variety. It is in the nature of the medium that it must suppress the content of ideas in order to accommodate the requirements of visual interest; that is to say, to accommodate the values of show business.</p>\n<p>how television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged. It is not merely that on the television screen entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails. As typography once dictated the style of conducting politics, religion, business, education, law and other important social matters, television now takes command.</p>\n<p>Post-debate commentary largely avoided any evaluation of the candidates’ ideas, since there were none to evaluate. Instead, the debates were conceived as boxing matches, the relevant question being, Who KO’d whom?</p>\n<p>Our priests and presidents, our surgeons and lawyers, our educators and newscasters need worry less about satisfying the demands of their discipline than the demands of good showmanship.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-now-this\">7. “Now . . . This”</h3>\n<p>“Now . . . this” is commonly used on radio and television newscasts to indicate that what one has just heard or seen has no relevance to what one is about to hear or see, or possibly to anything one is ever likely to hear or see.</p>\n<p>Television did not invent the “Now . . . this” world view. As I have tried to show, it is the offspring of the intercourse between telegraphy and photography.</p>\n<p>Stated in its simplest form, it is that television provides a new (or, possibly, restores an old) definition of truth: The credibility of the teller is the ultimate test of the truth of a proposition. “Credibility” here does not refer to the past record of the teller for making statements that have survived the rigors of reality-testing. It refers only to the impression of sincerity, authenticity, vulnerability or attractiveness (choose one or more) conveyed by the actor/reporter.</p>\n<p>it is quite obvious that TV news has no intention of suggesting that any story has any implications, for that would require viewers to continue to think about it when it is done and therefore obstruct their attending to the next story that waits panting in the wings.</p>\n<p>The viewers also know that no matter how grave any fragment of news may appear (for example, on the day I write a Marine Corps general has declared that nuclear war between the United States and Russia is inevitable), it will shortly be followed by a series of commercials that will, in an instant, defuse the import of the news, in fact render it largely banal.</p>\n<p>Imagine what you would think of me, and this book, if I were to pause here, tell you that I will return to my discussion in a moment, and then proceed to write a few words in behalf of United Airlines or the Chase Manhattan Bank. You would rightly think that I had no respect for you and, certainly, no respect for the subject. And if I did this not once but several times in each chapter, you would think the whole enterprise unworthy of your attention. Why, then, do we not think a news show similarly unworthy? The reason, I believe, is that whereas we expect books and even other media (such as film) to maintain a consistency of tone and a continuity of content, we have no such expectation of television, and especially television news. We have become so accustomed to its discontinuities that we are no longer struck dumb, as any sane person would be, by a newscaster who having just reported that a nuclear war is inevitable goes on to say that he will be right back after this word from Burger King; who says, in other words, “Now . . . this.”</p>\n<p>Disinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information—information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result.</p>\n<p>in saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable.

Religious programs are filled with good cheer.</p>\n<p>I think it both fair and obvious to say that on television, God is a vague and subordinate character. Though His name is invoked repeatedly, the concreteness and persistence of the image of the preacher carries the clear message that it is he, not He, who must be worshipped. I do not mean to imply that the preacher wishes it to be so; only that the power of a close-up televised face, in color, makes idolatry a continual hazard. Television is, after all, a form of graven imagery far more alluring than a golden calf.</p>\n<h3 id=\"9-reach-out-and-elect-someone\">9. Reach Out and Elect Someone</h3>\n<p>If politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether. And what the other matter is can be expressed in one word: advertising.</p>\n<p>One can like or dislike a television commercial, of course. But one cannot refute it. Indeed, we may go this far: The television commercial is not at all about the character of products to be consumed. It is about the character of the consumers of products.</p>\n<p>What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer. And so, the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research.</p>\n<p>The television commercial has oriented business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable, which means that the business of business has now become pseudo-therapy.</p>\n<p>The commercial asks us to believe that all problems are solvable, that they are solvable fast, and that they are solvable fast through the interventions of technology, techniques and chemistry. This is, of course, a preposterous theory about the roots of discontent, and would appear so to anyone hearing or reading it.</p>\n<p>television makes impossible the determination of who is better than whom, if we mean by “better” such things as more capable in negotiation, more imaginative in executive skill, more knowledgeable about international affairs, more understanding of the interrelations of economic systems, and so on.</p>\n<p>on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience.</p>\n<p>In the shift from party politics to television politics, the same goal is sought. We are not permitted to know who is best at being President or Governor or Senator, but whose image is best in touching and soothing the deep reaches of our discontent.</p>\n<p>Those who would be gods refashion themselves into images the viewers would have them be.</p>\n<p>just as the television commercial empties itself of authentic product information so that it can do its psychological work, image politics empties itself of authentic political substance for the same reason.</p>\n<p>The Bill of Rights is largely a prescription for preventing government from restricting the flow of information and ideas. But the Founding Fathers did not foresee that tyranny by government might be superseded by another sort of problem altogether, namely, the corporate state, which through television now controls the flow of public discourse in America.</p>\n<p>I would venture the opinion that the traditional civil libertarian opposition to the banning of books from school libraries and from school curricula is now largely irrelevant. Such acts of censorship are annoying, of course, and must be opposed. But they are trivial. Even worse, they are distracting, in that they divert civil libertarians from confronting those questions that have to do with the claims of new technologies. To put it plainly, a student’s freedom to read is not seriously injured by someone’s banning a book on Long Island or in Anaheim or anyplace else. But as Gerbner suggests, television clearly does impair the student’s freedom to read, and it does so with innocent hands, so to speak. Television does not ban books, it simply displaces them. The fight against censorship is a nineteenth-century issue which was largely won in the twentieth.\n<strong>Note:</strong> of course now banning is back, but mostly symbolic for tv etc</p>\n<p>Our Ministry of Culture is Huxleyan, not Orwellian. It does everything possible to encourage us to watch continuously.

I read _Technopoly_ previously and still found a lot of value in this.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2024/book.jpg\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Amusing Ourselves to Death book cover\">\n\n# My Reading Highlights and Notes\n\n<!--more-->\n\nHis questions can be asked about all technologies and media. What happens to us when we become infatuated with and then seduced by them? Do they free us or imprison us? Do they improve or degrade democracy? Do they make our leaders more accountable or less so? Our system more transparent or less so? Do they make us better citizens or better consumers? Are the trade-offs worth it? If they’re not worth it, yet we still can’t stop ourselves from embracing the next new thing because that’s just how we’re wired, then what strategies can we devise to maintain control? Dignity? Meaning?\n\nThis book is about the possibility that Huxley, not Orwell, was right.\n\n## Part I.\n\n### 1. The Medium Is the Metaphor\n\nOur politics, religion, news, athletics, education and commerce have been transformed into congenial adjuncts of show business, largely without protest or even much popular notice. The result is that we are a people on the verge of amusing ourselves to death.\n\nThere is no shortage of critics who have observed and recorded the dissolution of public discourse in America and its conversion into the arts of show business. But most of them, I believe, have barely begun to tell the story of the origin and meaning of this descent into a vast triviality.\n\nWe are all, as Huxley says someplace, Great Abbreviators, meaning that none of us has the wit to know the whole truth, the time to tell it if we believed we did, or an audience so gullible as to accept it.\n\nIt is an argument that fixes its attention on the forms of human conversation, and postulates that how we are obliged to conduct such conversations will have the strongest possible influence on what ideas we can conveniently express. And what ideas are convenient to express inevitably become the important content of a culture.\n\nFor on television, discourse is conducted largely through visual imagery, which is to say that television gives us a conversation in images, not words. The emergence of the image-manager in the political arena and the concomitant decline of the speech writer attest to the fact that television demands a different kind of content from other media. You cannot do political philosophy on television. Its form works against the content.\n\nWe attend to fragments of events from all over the world because we have multiple media whose forms are well suited to fragmented conversation.\n\nthe clearest way to see through a culture is to attend to its tools for conversation.\n\nPeople like ourselves who are in the process of converting their culture from word-centered to image-centered might profit by reflecting on this Mosaic injunction.\n\nWe know enough about language to understand that variations in the structures of languages will result in variations in what may be called “world view.” How people think about time and space, and about things and processes, will be greatly influenced by the grammatical features of their language.\n\nEach medium, like language itself, makes possible a unique mode of discourse by providing a new orientation for thought, for expression, for sensibility.\n\nperson who reads a book or who watches television or who glances at his watch is not usually interested in how his mind is organized and controlled by these events, still less in what idea of the world is suggested by a book, television, or a watch.\n\nIn Mumford’s great book Technics and Civilization, he shows how, beginning in the fourteenth century, the clock made us into time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers. In the process, we have learned irreverence toward the sun and the seasons, for in a world made up of seconds and minutes, the authority of nature is superseded.\n\nNonetheless, it is clear that phonetic writing created a new conception of knowledge, as well as a new sense of intelligence, of audience and of posterity, all of which Plato recognized at an early stage in the development of texts.\n\nWriting freezes speech and in so doing gives birth to the grammarian, the logician, the rhetorician, the historian, the scientist—all those who must hold language before them so that they can see what it means, where it errs, and where it is leading.\n\nwhat my book is about is how our own tribe is undergoing a vast and trembling shift from the magic of writing to the magic of electronics.\n\nWe are told in school, quite correctly, that a metaphor suggests what a thing is like by comparing it to something else. And by the power of its suggestion, it so fixes a conception in our minds that we cannot imagine the one thing without the other:\n\nin every tool we create, an idea is embedded that goes beyond the function of the thing itself.\n\nEyeglasses refuted the belief that anatomy is destiny by putting forward the idea that our bodies as well as our minds are improvable.\n\nAnd our languages are our media. Our media are our metaphors. Our metaphors create the content of our culture.\n\n### 2. Media as Epistemology\n\nIt is my intention in this book to show that a great media-metaphor shift has taken place in America, with the result that the content of much of our public discourse has become dangerous nonsense.\n\nI raise no objection to television’s junk. The best things on television are its junk, and no one and nothing is seriously threatened by it.\n\nwe do not measure a culture by its output of undisguised trivialities but by what it claims as significant.\n\nTherein is our problem, for television is at its most trivial and, therefore, most dangerous when its aspirations are high, when it presents itself as a carrier of important cultural conversations.\n\nWhatever the original and limited context of its use may have been, a medium has the power to fly far beyond that context into new and unexpected ones. Because of the way it directs us to organize our minds and integrate our experience of the world, it imposes itself on our consciousness and social institutions in myriad forms. It sometimes has the power to become implicated in our concepts of piety, or goodness, or beauty. And it is always implicated in the ways we define and regulate our ideas of truth.\n\nFor in a print-based courtroom, where law books, briefs, citations and other written materials define and organize the method of finding the truth, the oral tradition has lost much of its resonance—but not all of it. Testimony is expected to be given orally, on the assumption that the spoken, not the written, word is a truer reflection of the state of mind of a witness. Indeed, in many courtrooms jurors are not permitted to take notes, nor are they given written copies of the judge’s explanation of the law. Jurors are expected to hear the truth, or its opposite, not to read it. Thus, we may say that there is a clash of resonances in our concept of legal truth.\n\nthe written word is, by its nature, addressed to the world, not an individual.\n\nThe written word endures, the spoken word disappears; and that is why writing is closer to the truth than speaking.\n\nthe concept of truth is intimately linked to the biases of forms of expression. Truth does not, and never has, come unadorned. It must appear in its proper clothing or it is not acknowledged, which is a way of saying that the “truth” is a kind of cultural prejudice. Each culture conceives of it as being most authentically expressed in certain symbolic forms that another culture may regard as trivial or irrelevant.\n\n“Seeing is believing” has always had a preeminent status as an epistemological axiom, but “saying is believing,” “reading is believing,” “counting is believing,” “deducing is believing,” and “feeling is believing” are others that have risen or fallen in importance as cultures have undergone media change.\n\nSince intelligence is primarily defined as one’s capacity to grasp the truth of things, it follows that what a culture means by intelligence is derived from the character of its important forms of communication.\n\nMy argument is limited to saying that a major new medium changes the structure of discourse; it does so by encouraging certain uses of the intellect, by favoring certain definitions of intelligence and wisdom, and by demanding a certain kind of content—in a phrase, by creating new forms of truth-telling.\n\nI am arguing that a television-based epistemology pollutes public communication and its surrounding landscape, not that it pollutes everything.\n\nI will try to demonstrate that as typography moves to the periphery of our culture and television takes its place at the center, the seriousness, clarity and, above all, value of public discourse dangerously declines.\n\n### 3. Typographic America\n\nThe Dunkers came close here to formulating a commandment about religious discourse: Thou shalt not write down thy principles, still less print them, lest thou shall be entrapped by them for all time.\n\nthe Lyceum Movement had as its purpose the diffusion of knowledge, the promotion of common schools, the creation of libraries and, especially, the establishment of lecture halls.\n\nThe influence of the printed word in every arena of public discourse was insistent and powerful not merely because of the quantity of printed matter but because of its monopoly.\n\n### 4. The Typographic Mind\n\nIs there any audience of Americans today who could endure seven hours of talk? or five? or three? Especially without pictures of any kind?\n\nWhenever language is the principal medium of communication—especially language controlled by the rigors of print—an idea, a fact, a claim is the inevitable result. The idea may be banal, the fact irrelevant, the claim false, but there is no escape from meaning when language is the instrument guiding one’s thought.\n\nAs a consequence a language-centered discourse such as was characteristic of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America tends to be both content-laden and serious, all the more so when it takes its form from print.\n\nA written sentence calls upon its author to say something, upon its reader to know the import of what is said.\n\nThe reader must come armed, in a serious state of intellectual readiness. This is not easy because he comes to the text alone. In reading, one’s responses are isolated, one’s intellect thrown back on its own resources. To be confronted by the cold abstractions of printed sentences is to look upon language bare, without the assistance of either beauty or community.\n\nIn a print culture, writers make mistakes when they lie, contradict themselves, fail to support their generalizations, try to enforce illogical connections. In a print culture, readers make mistakes when they don’t notice, or even worse, don’t care.\n\nIf we may take advertising to be the voice of commerce, then its history tells very clearly that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries those with products to sell took their customers to be not unlike Daniel Webster: they assumed that potential buyers were literate, rational, analytical.\n\nIndeed, the history of newspaper advertising in America may be considered, all by itself, as a metaphor of the descent of the typographic mind, beginning, as it does, with reason, and ending, as it does, with entertainment.\n\nPublic figures were known largely by their written words, for example, not by their looks or even their oratory. It is quite likely that most of the first fifteen presidents of the United States would not have been recognized had they passed the average citizen in the street. This would have been the case as well of the great lawyers, ministers and scientists of that era. To think about those men was to think about what they had written, to judge them by their public positions, their arguments, their knowledge as codified in the printed word. You may get some sense of how we are separated from this kind of consciousness by thinking about any of our recent presidents; or even preachers, lawyers and scientists who are or who have recently been public figures. Think of Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter or Billy Graham, or even Albert Einstein, and what will come to your mind is an image, a picture of a face, most likely a face on a television screen (in Einstein’s case, a photograph of a face). Of words, almost nothing will come to mind. This is the difference between thinking in a word-centered culture and thinking in an image-centered culture.\n\nFor two centuries, America declared its intentions, expressed its ideology, designed its laws, sold its products, created its literature and addressed its deities with black squiggles on white paper.\n\nThe name I give to that period of time during which the American mind submitted itself to the sovereignty of the printing press is the Age of Exposition.\n\nAlmost all of the characteristics we associate with mature discourse were amplified by typography, which has the strongest possible bias toward exposition: a sophisticated ability to think conceptually, deductively and sequentially; a high valuation of reason and order; an abhorrence of contradiction; a large capacity for detachment and objectivity; and a tolerance for delayed response.\n\n### 5. The Peek-a-Boo World\n\nThoreau, as it turned out, was precisely correct. He grasped that the telegraph would create its own definition of discourse; that it would not only permit but insist upon a conversation between Maine and Texas; and that it would require the content of that conversation to be different from what Typographic Man was accustomed to.\n\ntelegraphy gave a form of legitimacy to the idea of context-free information; that is, to the idea that the value of information need not be tied to any function it might serve in social and political decision-making and action, but may attach merely to its novelty, interest, and curiosity. The telegraph made information into a commodity, a “thing” that could be bought and sold irrespective of its uses or meaning.\n\ntelegraphy made relevance irrelevant. The abundant flow of information had very little or nothing to do with those to whom it was addressed; that is, with any social or intellectual context in which their lives were embedded.\n\nHow often does it occur that information provided you on morning radio or television, or in the morning newspaper, causes you to alter your plans for the day, or to take some action you would not otherwise have taken, or provides insight into some problem you are required to solve?\n\nmost of our daily news is inert, consisting of information that gives us something to talk about but cannot lead to any meaningful action. This fact is the principal legacy of the telegraph: By generating an abundance of irrelevant information, it dramatically altered what may be called the “information-action ratio.”\n**Tags:** definition\n\nYou may get a sense of what this means by asking yourself another series of questions: What steps do you plan to take to reduce the conflict in the Middle East? Or the rates of inflation, crime and unemployment? What are your plans for preserving the environment or reducing the risk of nuclear war? What do you plan to do about NATO, OPEC, the CIA, affirmative action, and the monstrous treatment of the Baha’is in Iran? I shall take the liberty of answering for you: You plan to do nothing about them. You may, of course, cast a ballot for someone who claims to have some plans, as well as the power to act. But this you can do only once every two or four years by giving one hour of your time, hardly a satisfying means of expressing the broad range of opinions you hold.\n\nWe may say then that the contribution of the telegraph to public discourse was to dignify irrelevance and amplify impotence.\n\nThe principal strength of the telegraph was its capacity to move information, not collect it, explain it or analyze it. In this respect, telegraphy was the exact opposite of typography. Books, for example, are an excellent container for the accumulation, quiet scrutiny and organized analysis of information and ideas.\n\n“Knowing” the facts took on a new meaning, for it did not imply that one understood implications, background, or connections.\n\nIn a peculiar way, the photograph was the perfect complement to the flood of telegraphic news-from-nowhere that threatened to submerge readers in a sea of facts from unknown places about strangers with unknown faces. For the photograph gave a concrete reality to the strange-sounding datelines, and attached faces to the unknown names. Thus it provided the illusion, at least, that “the news” had a connection to something within one’s sensory experience. It created an apparent context for the “news of the day.” And the “news of the day” created a context for the photograph.\n\nIt may be of some interest to note, in this connection, that the crossword puzzle became a popular form of diversion in America at just that point when the telegraph and the photograph had achieved the transformation of news from functional information to decontextualized fact. This coincidence suggests that the new technologies had turned the age-old problem of information on its head: Where people once sought information to manage the real contexts of their lives, now they had to invent contexts in which otherwise useless information might be put to some apparent use. The crossword puzzle is one such pseudo-context; the cocktail party is another; the radio quiz shows of the 1930s and 1940s and the modern television game show are still others; and the ultimate, perhaps, is the wildly successful “Trivial Pursuit.” In one form or another, each of these supplies an answer to the question, “What am I to do with all these disconnected facts?” And in one form or another, the, answer is the same: Why not use them for diversion? for entertainment? to amuse yourself, in a game?\n\nthe loss of the sense of the strange is a sign of adjustment, and the extent to which we have adjusted is a measure of the extent to which we have been changed.\n\nI will try to demonstrate by concrete example that television’s way of knowing is uncompromisingly hostile to typography’s way of knowing; that television’s conversations promote incoherence and triviality; that the phrase “serious television” is a contradiction in terms; and that television speaks in only one persistent voice—the voice of entertainment.\n\n## Part II.\n\n### 6. The Age of Show Business\n\nIf television is a continuation of anything, it is of a tradition begun by the telegraph and photograph in the mid-nineteenth century, not by the printing press in the fifteenth.\n\nI must begin by making a distinction between a technology and a medium. We might say that a technology is to a medium as the brain is to the mind. Like the brain, a technology is a physical apparatus. Like the mind, a medium is a use to which a physical apparatus is put. A technology becomes a medium as it employs a particular symbolic code, as it finds its place in a particular social setting, as it insinuates itself into economic and political contexts. A technology, in other words, is merely a machine. A medium is the social and intellectual environment a machine creates.\n\nevery technology has an inherent bias. It has within its physical form a predisposition toward being used in certain ways and not others.\n\nThe average length of a shot on network television is only 3.5 seconds, so that the eye never rests, always has something new to see.\n**Note:** surely much shorter since this was written\n\nwhat I am claiming here is not that television is entertaining but that it has made entertainment itself the natural format for the representation of all experience. Our television set keeps us in constant communion with the world, but it does so with a face whose smiling countenance is unalterable. The problem is not that television presents us with entertaining subject matter but that all subject matter is presented as entertaining, which is another issue altogether.\n\nThere is no conspiracy here, no lack of intelligence, only a straightforward recognition that “good television” has little to do with what is “good” about exposition or other forms of verbal communication but everything to do with what the pictorial images look like.\n\nalmost all television programs are embedded in music, which helps to tell the audience what emotions are to be called forth.\n\nWhen a television show is in process, it is very nearly impermissible to say, “Let me think about that” or “I don’t know” or “What do you mean when you say . . . ?” or “From what sources does your information come?” This type of discourse not only slows down the tempo of the show but creates the impression of uncertainty or lack of finish.\n\nThinking does not play well on television, a fact that television directors discovered long ago. There is not much to see in it. It is, in a phrase, not a performing art.\n\nThe single most important fact about television is that people watch it, which is why it is called “television.” And what they watch, and like to watch, are moving pictures—millions of them, of short duration and dynamic variety. It is in the nature of the medium that it must suppress the content of ideas in order to accommodate the requirements of visual interest; that is to say, to accommodate the values of show business.\n\nhow television stages the world becomes the model for how the world is properly to be staged. It is not merely that on the television screen entertainment is the metaphor for all discourse. It is that off the screen the same metaphor prevails. As typography once dictated the style of conducting politics, religion, business, education, law and other important social matters, television now takes command.\n\nPost-debate commentary largely avoided any evaluation of the candidates’ ideas, since there were none to evaluate. Instead, the debates were conceived as boxing matches, the relevant question being, Who KO’d whom?\n\nOur priests and presidents, our surgeons and lawyers, our educators and newscasters need worry less about satisfying the demands of their discipline than the demands of good showmanship.\n\n### 7. “Now . . . This”\n\n“Now . . . this” is commonly used on radio and television newscasts to indicate that what one has just heard or seen has no relevance to what one is about to hear or see, or possibly to anything one is ever likely to hear or see.\n\nTelevision did not invent the “Now . . . this” world view. As I have tried to show, it is the offspring of the intercourse between telegraphy and photography.\n\nStated in its simplest form, it is that television provides a new (or, possibly, restores an old) definition of truth: The credibility of the teller is the ultimate test of the truth of a proposition. “Credibility” here does not refer to the past record of the teller for making statements that have survived the rigors of reality-testing. It refers only to the impression of sincerity, authenticity, vulnerability or attractiveness (choose one or more) conveyed by the actor/reporter.\n\nit is quite obvious that TV news has no intention of suggesting that any story has any implications, for that would require viewers to continue to think about it when it is done and therefore obstruct their attending to the next story that waits panting in the wings.\n\nThe viewers also know that no matter how grave any fragment of news may appear (for example, on the day I write a Marine Corps general has declared that nuclear war between the United States and Russia is inevitable), it will shortly be followed by a series of commercials that will, in an instant, defuse the import of the news, in fact render it largely banal.\n\nImagine what you would think of me, and this book, if I were to pause here, tell you that I will return to my discussion in a moment, and then proceed to write a few words in behalf of United Airlines or the Chase Manhattan Bank. You would rightly think that I had no respect for you and, certainly, no respect for the subject. And if I did this not once but several times in each chapter, you would think the whole enterprise unworthy of your attention. Why, then, do we not think a news show similarly unworthy? The reason, I believe, is that whereas we expect books and even other media (such as film) to maintain a consistency of tone and a continuity of content, we have no such expectation of television, and especially television news. We have become so accustomed to its discontinuities that we are no longer struck dumb, as any sane person would be, by a newscaster who having just reported that a nuclear war is inevitable goes on to say that he will be right back after this word from Burger King; who says, in other words, “Now . . . this.”\n\nDisinformation does not mean false information. It means misleading information—misplaced, irrelevant, fragmented or superficial information—information that creates the illusion of knowing something but which in fact leads one away from knowing. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that television news deliberately aims to deprive Americans of a coherent, contextual understanding of their world. I mean to say that when news is packaged as entertainment, that is the inevitable result.\n\nin saying that the television news show entertains but does not inform, I am saying something far more serious than that we are being deprived of authentic information. I am saying we are losing our sense of what it means to be well informed. Ignorance is always correctable. But what shall we do if we take ignorance to be knowledge?\n\nHuxley grasped, as Orwell did not, that it is not necessary to conceal anything from a public insensible to contradiction and narcoticized by technological diversions.\n\nAmerica’s newest and highly successful national newspaper, USA Today, is modeled precisely on the format of television.\n\nIn the age of television, the paragraph is becoming the basic unit of news in print media.\n\nthe time cannot be far off when awards will be given for the best investigative sentence.\n\nWhereas television taught the magazines that news is nothing but entertainment, the magazines have taught television that nothing but entertainment is news.\n\n### 8. Shuffle Off to Bethlehem\n\non television, religion, like everything else, is presented, quite simply and without apology, as an entertainment. Everything that makes religion an historic, profound and sacred human activity is stripped away; there is no ritual, no dogma, no tradition, no theology, and above all, no sense of spiritual transcendence. On these shows, the preacher is tops. God comes out as second banana.\n\nthere is always the question, What is lost in the translation?\n\nTo come to the point, there are several characteristics of television and its surround that converge to make authentic religious experience impossible. The first has to do with the fact that there is no way to consecrate the space in which a television show is experienced.\n\nThe executive director of the National Religious Broadcasters Association sums up what he calls the unwritten law of all television preachers: “You can get your share of the audience only by offering people something they want.”[3] You will note, I am sure, that this is an unusual religious credo. There is no great religious leader—from the Buddha to Moses to Jesus to Mohammed to Luther—who offered people what they want. Only what they need.\n\nwhat is preached on television is not anything like the Sermon on the Mount. Religious programs are filled with good cheer.\n\nI think it both fair and obvious to say that on television, God is a vague and subordinate character. Though His name is invoked repeatedly, the concreteness and persistence of the image of the preacher carries the clear message that it is he, not He, who must be worshipped. I do not mean to imply that the preacher wishes it to be so; only that the power of a close-up televised face, in color, makes idolatry a continual hazard. Television is, after all, a form of graven imagery far more alluring than a golden calf.\n\n### 9. Reach Out and Elect Someone\n\nIf politics is like show business, then the idea is not to pursue excellence, clarity or honesty but to appear as if you are, which is another matter altogether. And what the other matter is can be expressed in one word: advertising.\n\nOne can like or dislike a television commercial, of course. But one cannot refute it. Indeed, we may go this far: The television commercial is not at all about the character of products to be consumed. It is about the character of the consumers of products.\n\nWhat the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer. And so, the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research.\n\nThe television commercial has oriented business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable, which means that the business of business has now become pseudo-therapy.\n\nThe commercial asks us to believe that all problems are solvable, that they are solvable fast, and that they are solvable fast through the interventions of technology, techniques and chemistry. This is, of course, a preposterous theory about the roots of discontent, and would appear so to anyone hearing or reading it.\n\ntelevision makes impossible the determination of who is better than whom, if we mean by “better” such things as more capable in negotiation, more imaginative in executive skill, more knowledgeable about international affairs, more understanding of the interrelations of economic systems, and so on.\n\non television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience.\n\nIn the shift from party politics to television politics, the same goal is sought. We are not permitted to know who is best at being President or Governor or Senator, but whose image is best in touching and soothing the deep reaches of our discontent.\n\nThose who would be gods refashion themselves into images the viewers would have them be.\n\njust as the television commercial empties itself of authentic product information so that it can do its psychological work, image politics empties itself of authentic political substance for the same reason.\n\nThe Bill of Rights is largely a prescription for preventing government from restricting the flow of information and ideas. But the Founding Fathers did not foresee that tyranny by government might be superseded by another sort of problem altogether, namely, the corporate state, which through television now controls the flow of public discourse in America.\n\nI would venture the opinion that the traditional civil libertarian opposition to the banning of books from school libraries and from school curricula is now largely irrelevant. Such acts of censorship are annoying, of course, and must be opposed. But they are trivial. Even worse, they are distracting, in that they divert civil libertarians from confronting those questions that have to do with the claims of new technologies. To put it plainly, a student’s freedom to read is not seriously injured by someone’s banning a book on Long Island or in Anaheim or anyplace else. But as Gerbner suggests, television clearly does impair the student’s freedom to read, and it does so with innocent hands, so to speak. Television does not ban books, it simply displaces them. The fight against censorship is a nineteenth-century issue which was largely won in the twentieth.\n**Note:** of course now banning is back, but mostly symbolic for tv etc\n\nOur Ministry of Culture is Huxleyan, not Orwellian. It does everything possible to encourage us to watch continuously. But what we watch is a medium which presents information in a form that renders it simplistic, nonsubstantive, nonhistorical and noncontextual;\n\n### 10. Teaching as an Amusing Activity\n\nin doing away with the idea of sequence and continuity in education, television undermines the idea that sequence and continuity have anything to do with thought itself.\n\n### 11. The Huxleyan Warning\n\nThere are two ways by which the spirit of a culture may be shriveled. In the first—the Orwellian—culture becomes a prison. In the second—the Huxleyan—culture becomes a burlesque.\n\nOf course, Orwell was not the first to teach us about the spiritual devastations of tyranny. What is irreplaceable about his work is his insistence that it makes little difference if our wardens are inspired by right- or left-wing ideologies. The gates of the prison are equally impenetrable, surveillance equally rigorous, icon-worship equally pervasive.\n\nIn the Huxleyan prophecy, Big Brother does not watch us, by his choice. We watch him, by ours.\n\nAn Orwellian world is much easier to recognize, and to oppose, than a Huxleyan.\n\nTo be unaware that a technology comes equipped with a program for social change, to maintain that technology is neutral, to make the assumption that technology is always a friend to culture is, at this late hour, stupidity plain and simple.\n\nIt is almost equally unrealistic to expect that nontrivial modifications in the availability of media will ever be made.\n\nI am particularly fond of John Lindsay’s suggestion that political commercials be banned from television as we now ban cigarette and liquor commercials.\n\nTelevision, as I have implied earlier, serves us most usefully when presenting junk-entertainment; it serves us most ill when it co-opts serious modes of discourse—news, politics, science, education, commerce, religion—and turns them into entertainment packages. We would all be better off if television got worse, not better. The A-Team and Cheers are no threat to our public health. 60 Minutes, Eye-Witness News and Sesame Street are.\n\nThe problem, in any case, does not reside in what people watch. The problem is in that we watch. The solution must be found in how we watch.\n\nWhat I suggest here as a solution is what Aldous Huxley suggested, as well. And I can do no better than he. He believed with H. G. Wells that we are in a race between education and disaster, and he wrote continuously about the necessity of our understanding the politics and epistemology of media. For in the end, he was trying to tell us that what afflicted the people in Brave New World was not that they were laughing instead of thinking, but that they did not know what they were laughing about and why they had stopped thinking.\n",

Everything was new then and we were constantly learning.</p>\n<p>people remember duration as being shorter on a routine activity than on a nonroutine activity.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"150-people\">150 PEOPLE</h3>\n<p>Kanazawa calls his idea the Savanna Theory of Happiness, and the general rule of thumb is, the higher the population density wherever a person is, the less happy they’ll likely be.</p>\n<h3 id=\"101-miles\">101 MILES</h3>\n<p>Our general discomfort with solitude may be due to how society frames it. Consider how we discipline children: time-out. Or how we punish prisoners: solitary confinement. This tradition, Bowker thinks, may have cued us to believe that normalcy is found through others and that solitude is punishment.</p>\n<p>Research backs solitude’s healthy properties. It’s been shown to improve productivity, creativity, empathy, and happiness, and decrease self-consciousness.</p>\n<h3 id=\"less-than-70-miles-an-hour\">(less than) 70 MILES AN HOUR</h3>\n<h3 id=\"11-hours-6-minutes\">11 HOURS, 6 MINUTES</h3>\n<p>our collective lack of boredom is not only burning us out and leading to some ill mental health effects, but also muting what boredom is trying to tell us about our mind, emotions, ideas, wants, and needs.</p>\n<p>Our brains essentially have two modes, focused and unfocused. Focused mode is a mind at attention. It’s on when we’re processing outside information, completing a task, checking our cellphone, watching TV, listening to a podcast, having a conversation, or anything else that requires us to attend to the outside world. Unfocused mode occurs when we’re not paying attention. It’s inward mind-wandering, a rest state that restores and rebuilds the resources needed to work better and more efficiently in the focused state. Time in unfocused mode is critical to get shit done, tap into creativity, process complicated information, and more.</p>\n<p>Each time we reflexively take out our phone or turn on a computer or TV to kill boredom, it attaches another tiny anchor to our stress tolerance, dragging it lower. Scientists at Oregon State University found that daily stressors like lines and waits can improve our resistance to some brain diseases if we simply suffer through them and shrug them off. More of these everyday stressors are actually better for our brain.</p>\n<p>And so, despite what productivity gurus will have us believe, the key to improving productivity and performance might be to occasionally do nothing at all. Or, at least, not dive into a screen. It prompts us to think distinctly, in a way that delivers more original ideas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"20-minutes-5-hours-3-days\">20 MINUTES, 5 HOURS, 3 DAYS</h3>\n<p>They discovered that 20 minutes outside, three times a week, is the dose of nature that most efficiently dropped people’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The catch to that study, of course, was that the participants couldn’t take their phones outside with them.</p>\n<p>In nature your brain enters a mode Hopman called “soft fascination.” It’s similar to unfocused mode—but with one key difference. “Instead of mind-wandering and lightly focusing inwardly, you’re lightly focusing outwardly on the nature around you,”</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Brain scans show that soft fascination is a lot like meditation. Hopman described it as a mindfulness-like state that restores and builds the resources we need to think, create, process information, and execute tasks.</p>\n<p>Twenty minutes, three times a week, is great. But it’s at the bottom of what some nature scientists have dubbed “the nature pyramid.”</p>\n<p>Time in this semiwild stuff comprises level two of the nature pyramid. Research, in part thanks to Finland, says we should spend a total of about five hours in it a month.</p>\n<p>The rewilding of our body and brain usually goes something like this: On the first day stress and health markers improve, but we are still adjusting to the discomfort of nature. We’re thinking about how it sucks to be cold, missing our phone, and still focusing on the anxieties we left behind—what’s happening at work and whether we closed the garage door. By day two our mind is settling and awareness is heightening. We’re caring less about what we left behind and are beginning to notice the sights, smells, and sounds around us. Then day three hits. Now our senses are completely dialed in and we can reach a fully meditative mode of feeling connected to nature. The discomfort isn’t so bad. It has, in fact, shifted to a welcome sensation that signals a calmness and feeling of life satisfaction.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-places\">12 PLACES</h3>\n<p>Our brains are wired to think loud = danger. We react by releasing adrenaline and cortisol, stress hormones that kick on the fight-or-flight response. Our doses of noise-induced stress hormones used to be infrequent but lifesaving. Today’s jarring background noises spur the same fight-or-flight response. But the difference is that these noises are nearly constant.</p>\n<p>Gordon Hempton traveled the country in search of silence. He now believes that there are only 12 places in the Lower 48 where we can sit for 15 minutes and not hear a single noise created by humans. No droning planes, trains, automobiles. No blaring TVs, cellphones, or radios. Just natural soundscape. Some of these 12 places are spots in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Hawaii’s Haleakala National Park, and Washington’s Hoh River Valley. North America’s other consistently quiet places are way up north, where I am: Alaska, the Arctic, Yukon, Northwest Territories, etc.</p>\n<h3 id=\"-4000-calories\">-4,000 CALORIES</h3>\n<p>The Japanese call this kuchisabishii, which literally means “lonely mouth” and describes our constant mindless eating.</p>\n<p><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</p>\n<p>Just 3 percent of the people who lose weight in a given year manage to keep it off. Their secret isn’t some special food or exercise no one else has. It’s their ability to get comfortable with discomfort.</p>\n<p>Continuously trying to add more stuff on top of what you’re doing and constantly experimenting with shiny new things is almost never the answer. It just adds another layer of stress and complication. I believe people should be doing less and eliminating limiters to progress.</p>\n<p>Each person tracked and reported:</p>\n<p>• How much and what they ate. This involved weighing all the food the person ate to know true serving sizes and, therefore, calories.\n• Their typical daily routine.\n• Their sleep schedule.\n• Their stress and energy levels.\n• Their daily weight.\n• Their workouts and step counts.</p>\n<p>“I quickly ‘solved’ hundreds of problems just by virtue of improving a person’s awareness of their own behavior,” he said.</p>\n<p>Once we eat, our brain releases dopamine, rewarding us for the behavior. This creates a circuit in the brain that associates food with dopamine.</p>\n<p>Our brains evolved to release more dopamine when eating calorie-packed foods</p>\n<p>The carb-fat combo doesn’t exist naturally, but it’s one that humans clamor for,</p>\n<p>He recommended that I distract the discomfort of reward hunger with another form of discomfort: light exercise. “Find some ‘calorie negative’ ways of dealing with stress,” he said. “Walking is my number one. It relieves more stress and is health promoting. It leads you to burn calories rather than onboard them. And it removes you from the situation and adds time for reflection, where you can realize that you weren’t really hungry.”</p>\n<p>Humans and other primates are uniquely predisposed to chronic stress. That’s because we’re smart, social creatures who have a lot of downtime to be “miserable to each other and stress each other out,” according to Robert Sapolsky,</p>\n<p>The key quality that made a food filling: how heavy its 240-calorie serving size was.</p>\n<h3 id=\"12-to-16-hours\">12 TO 16 HOURS</h3>\n<p>Rarely feeling real hunger is a strong sign that a person is suffering from the ill effects of comfort creep,</p>\n<p>The data shows that we don’t typically gain weight in a linear fashion, like a quarter pound each month for a total of three pounds at the end of the year. Most of us maintain our weight most of the year, then experience periods of gain,</p>\n<p>But it is agreed that these people weren’t eating around the clock. The research suggests they likely ate one or two meals a day.</p>\n<p>Other research shows that programming two “hungry days” per week where we eat around 500 calories delivers benefits.</p>\n<p>Another option is to string together five “hungry days” in a row, once a month, eating just 700 total calories.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-good-legs\">3 GOOD LEGS</h3>\n<h3 id=\"1231-115933pm\">12/31, 11:59:33 P.M.</h3>\n<p>some scholars have argued that American attempts to dematerialize are just another form of materialism.</p>\n<p>It consists of “cramming our lives with compulsive activity, so that there is no time at all to confront the real issues….If we look into our lives, we will see clearly how many unimportant tasks, so-called ‘responsibilities’ accumulate to fill them up….Going on as we do, obsessively trying to improve our conditions, can become an end in itself and a pointless distraction.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"100-pounds\">100+ POUNDS</h3>\n<h3 id=\"50-pounds\">≤50 POUNDS</h3>\n<h3 id=\"80-percent\">80 PERCENT</h3>\n<h3 id=\"812-years\">81.2 YEARS</h3>\n",

But clumsily exiting our comfort zones offers way too many upsides to ignore.\n\nlearning new skills is also one of the best ways to enhance awareness of the present moment,\n\nOnce we’ve done something over and over, our mind zones out of whatever old thing it’s doing.\n\nIn newness we’re forced into presence and focus. This is because we can’t anticipate what to expect and how to respond, breaking the trance that leads to life in fast forward. Newness can even slow down our sense of time. This explains why time seemed slower when we were kids. Everything was new then and we were constantly learning.\n\npeople remember duration as being shorter on a routine activity than on a nonroutine activity.”\n\n### 150 PEOPLE\n\nKanazawa calls his idea the Savanna Theory of Happiness, and the general rule of thumb is, the higher the population density wherever a person is, the less happy they’ll likely be.\n\n### 101 MILES\n\nOur general discomfort with solitude may be due to how society frames it. Consider how we discipline children: time-out. Or how we punish prisoners: solitary confinement. This tradition, Bowker thinks, may have cued us to believe that normalcy is found through others and that solitude is punishment.\n\nResearch backs solitude’s healthy properties. It’s been shown to improve productivity, creativity, empathy, and happiness, and decrease self-consciousness.\n\n### (less than) 70 MILES AN HOUR\n\n### 11 HOURS, 6 MINUTES\n\nour collective lack of boredom is not only burning us out and leading to some ill mental health effects, but also muting what boredom is trying to tell us about our mind, emotions, ideas, wants, and needs.\n\nOur brains essentially have two modes, focused and unfocused. Focused mode is a mind at attention. It’s on when we’re processing outside information, completing a task, checking our cellphone, watching TV, listening to a podcast, having a conversation, or anything else that requires us to attend to the outside world. Unfocused mode occurs when we’re not paying attention. It’s inward mind-wandering, a rest state that restores and rebuilds the resources needed to work better and more efficiently in the focused state. Time in unfocused mode is critical to get shit done, tap into creativity, process complicated information, and more.\n\nEach time we reflexively take out our phone or turn on a computer or TV to kill boredom, it attaches another tiny anchor to our stress tolerance, dragging it lower. Scientists at Oregon State University found that daily stressors like lines and waits can improve our resistance to some brain diseases if we simply suffer through them and shrug them off. More of these everyday stressors are actually better for our brain.\n\nAnd so, despite what productivity gurus will have us believe, the key to improving productivity and performance might be to occasionally do nothing at all. Or, at least, not dive into a screen. It prompts us to think distinctly, in a way that delivers more original ideas.\n\n### 20 MINUTES, 5 HOURS, 3 DAYS\n\nThey discovered that 20 minutes outside, three times a week, is the dose of nature that most efficiently dropped people’s levels of the stress hormone cortisol. The catch to that study, of course, was that the participants couldn’t take their phones outside with them.\n\nIn nature your brain enters a mode Hopman called “soft fascination.” It’s similar to unfocused mode—but with one key difference. “Instead of mind-wandering and lightly focusing inwardly, you’re lightly focusing outwardly on the nature around you,”\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\nBrain scans show that soft fascination is a lot like meditation. Hopman described it as a mindfulness-like state that restores and builds the resources we need to think, create, process information, and execute tasks.\n\nTwenty minutes, three times a week, is great. But it’s at the bottom of what some nature scientists have dubbed “the nature pyramid.”\n\nTime in this semiwild stuff comprises level two of the nature pyramid. Research, in part thanks to Finland, says we should spend a total of about five hours in it a month.\n\nThe rewilding of our body and brain usually goes something like this: On the first day stress and health markers improve, but we are still adjusting to the discomfort of nature. We’re thinking about how it sucks to be cold, missing our phone, and still focusing on the anxieties we left behind—what’s happening at work and whether we closed the garage door. By day two our mind is settling and awareness is heightening. We’re caring less about what we left behind and are beginning to notice the sights, smells, and sounds around us. Then day three hits. Now our senses are completely dialed in and we can reach a fully meditative mode of feeling connected to nature. The discomfort isn’t so bad. It has, in fact, shifted to a welcome sensation that signals a calmness and feeling of life satisfaction.\n\n### 12 PLACES\n\nOur brains are wired to think loud = danger. We react by releasing adrenaline and cortisol, stress hormones that kick on the fight-or-flight response. Our doses of noise-induced stress hormones used to be infrequent but lifesaving. Today’s jarring background noises spur the same fight-or-flight response. But the difference is that these noises are nearly constant.\n\nGordon Hempton traveled the country in search of silence. He now believes that there are only 12 places in the Lower 48 where we can sit for 15 minutes and not hear a single noise created by humans. No droning planes, trains, automobiles. No blaring TVs, cellphones, or radios. Just natural soundscape. Some of these 12 places are spots in Minnesota’s Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, Hawaii’s Haleakala National Park, and Washington’s Hoh River Valley. North America’s other consistently quiet places are way up north, where I am: Alaska, the Arctic, Yukon, Northwest Territories, etc.\n\n### -4,000 CALORIES\n\nThe Japanese call this kuchisabishii, which literally means “lonely mouth” and describes our constant mindless eating.\n\n**Tags:** definition\n\nJust 3 percent of the people who lose weight in a given year manage to keep it off. Their secret isn’t some special food or exercise no one else has. It’s their ability to get comfortable with discomfort.\n\nContinuously trying to add more stuff on top of what you’re doing and constantly experimenting with shiny new things is almost never the answer. It just adds another layer of stress and complication. I believe people should be doing less and eliminating limiters to progress.\n\nEach person tracked and reported:\n\n• How much and what they ate. This involved weighing all the food the person ate to know true serving sizes and, therefore, calories.\n• Their typical daily routine.\n• Their sleep schedule.\n• Their stress and energy levels.\n• Their daily weight.\n• Their workouts and step counts.\n\n“I quickly ‘solved’ hundreds of problems just by virtue of improving a person’s awareness of their own behavior,” he said.\n\nOnce we eat, our brain releases dopamine, rewarding us for the behavior. This creates a circuit in the brain that associates food with dopamine.\n\nOur brains evolved to release more dopamine when eating calorie-packed foods\n\nThe carb-fat combo doesn’t exist naturally, but it’s one that humans clamor for,\n\nHe recommended that I distract the discomfort of reward hunger with another form of discomfort: light exercise. “Find some ‘calorie negative’ ways of dealing with stress,” he said. “Walking is my number one. It relieves more stress and is health promoting. It leads you to burn calories rather than onboard them. And it removes you from the situation and adds time for reflection, where you can realize that you weren’t really hungry.”\n\nHumans and other primates are uniquely predisposed to chronic stress. That’s because we’re smart, social creatures who have a lot of downtime to be “miserable to each other and stress each other out,” according to Robert Sapolsky,\n\nThe key quality that made a food filling: how heavy its 240-calorie serving size was.\n\n### 12 TO 16 HOURS\n\nRarely feeling real hunger is a strong sign that a person is suffering from the ill effects of comfort creep,\n\nThe data shows that we don’t typically gain weight in a linear fashion, like a quarter pound each month for a total of three pounds at the end of the year. Most of us maintain our weight most of the year, then experience periods of gain,\n\nBut it is agreed that these people weren’t eating around the clock. The research suggests they likely ate one or two meals a day.\n\nOther research shows that programming two “hungry days” per week where we eat around 500 calories delivers benefits.\n\nAnother option is to string together five “hungry days” in a row, once a month, eating just 700 total calories.\n\n### 3 GOOD LEGS\n\n### 12/31, 11:59:33 P.M.\n\nsome scholars have argued that American attempts to dematerialize are just another form of materialism.\n\nIt consists of “cramming our lives with compulsive activity, so that there is no time at all to confront the real issues….If we look into our lives, we will see clearly how many unimportant tasks, so-called ‘responsibilities’ accumulate to fill them up….Going on as we do, obsessively trying to improve our conditions, can become an end in itself and a pointless distraction.”\n\n### 100+ POUNDS\n\n### ≤50 POUNDS\n\n### 80 PERCENT\n\n### 81.2 YEARS\n\n",

In the temptation narratives in the Gospels, Satan is described as ruler over all the kingdoms in the world: The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, “I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to.” (Luke 4:5-6) I don’t think the connection between the spiritual and the political could be any clearer. The price for political power is spiritual allegiance. Jesus rejects both offers, refusing to worship Satan and refusing to rule the world through political power. Turning his back on Satan, Jesus sets out to establish a very different sort of kingdom exercising a very different sort of power as a very different sort of King.&quot; (Richard Beck, Reviving Old Scratch)\">\n",

It has just about the right blend of &ldquo;friction&rdquo; and &ldquo;flow&rdquo;, meaning that it is not so easy to use that it leads to overcommitment and overwhelm, nor so hard to use that I avoid it or feel overly slowed down.</p>\n<p>The ability to easily restart (without losing anything) is a huge plus for those of us who feel the frequent temptation of starting over or trying new systems. The aforementioned sweet spot also helps prevent system switch.</p>\n<p>The one thing I don&rsquo;t feel like it satisfactorily addresses is &ldquo;in which of my places is that Inbox, Project, Area, Resource, or Archive?&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m tempted to make one storage location my &ldquo;main&rdquo; with some sort of index, but don&rsquo;t want to overwhelm the system. <em>How have you addressed this?</em></p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"my-reading-highlights-and-notes\">My Reading Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<h2 id=\"introduction-how-to-read-this-book\">INTRODUCTION How to Read This Book</h2>\n<p>PROMISE #1: You will stop wasting time looking for information: You will know exactly where your most important notes and documents live, and how to find them in seconds.</p>\n<p>PROMISE #2: You will gain greater focus on what matters most: You will have greater clarity about what’s important so you can intentionally move your life into alignment with your interests and goals.</p>\n<p>PROMISE #3: You will make things happen: You will consistently finish what you start, beating procrastination and tapping into your past learning to make progress fast.</p>\n<p>PROMISE #4: Your creativity and productivity will soar: You will have access to a playground of your own ideas to finally do the creative work that’s been locked up inside you.</p>\n<p>PROMISE #5: You will beat information overload and FOMO: The fear of missing out on a key piece of information will disappear and be replaced with the confidence that you have everything you need to get started.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-1-the-fundamentals-of-para\">PART 1 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PARA</h2>\n<h3 id=\"1-introducing-para\">1 Introducing PARA</h3>\n<p>Such a system would need to be incredibly easy to set up, and even easier to maintain. After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term.\n<em><strong>Note:</strong> yet there is value in friction re: recall and evaluation. How to manage this tension?</em></p>\n<p>use it in every one of the many places where you store information.\n<em><strong>Note:</strong> OK, but how do I know which one it lives in? (this does not get answered satisfactorily.)</em></p>\n<p>Whether you want to save excerpts from a book you’re reading,\n<em><strong>Note:</strong> Seems like overkill if you make a lot of highlights&hellip;but then again, maybe they should go in 04 Archive if they are not useful.</em></p>\n<p>You have <strong>projects</strong> you’re actively working on—short-term efforts (whether in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind.\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n<p>You have areas of <strong>responsibility</strong>—important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention more broadly.\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n<p>Then you have <strong>resources</strong> on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about,\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n<p>Finally, you have <strong>archives</strong>, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active but you might want to save for future reference:\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n<p>The system you use to organize information has to be so simple that it frees up your attention, instead of taking more of it. Your system must give you time, not take time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-the-power-of-organizing-by-project\">2 The Power of Organizing by Project</h3>\n<p>there are two critical things you cannot do until you break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects.</p>\n<p>OBSTACLE #1: You Can’t Truly Know the Extent of Your Commitments</p>\n<p>OBSTACLE #2: You Can’t Connect Your Current Efforts to Your Long-Term Goals</p>\n<p>What does our motivation depend on? Mostly, on making consistent progress. We can endure quite a bit of stress and frustration in the short term if we know it’s leading somewhere.</p>\n<p>without a list of individual projects, you can’t connect your current efforts to your long-term goals.</p>\n<p>When you break down your responsibilities into bite-size projects, you ensure that your project list is constantly turning over. This turnover creates a cadence of regular victories that you get to celebrate every time you successfully complete a project.</p>\n<p>Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go. It is about organizing information in such a way that it supports and calls into being the future life you want to lead.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-the-sixty-second-para-setup-guide\">3 The Sixty-Second PARA Setup Guide</h3>\n<p>Step 1: Archive existing files\nStep 2: Create project folders\nStep 3: Create additional folders as needed</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-1-archive-existing-files\">STEP 1: Archive Existing Files</h4>\n<p>The problem with keeping everything is that it quickly starts to consume a resource even more scarce than physical space: your attention.\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> favorite</em></p>\n<p>select all the existing files, documents, folders, notes, etc. in your Documents folder (which may number in the hundreds or even thousands or more) and move them all at once into a new folder called “Archive [Today’s date].”</p>\n<p>Then, place this new dated archive folder inside another, larger folder titled simply “Archives,” which will be the official home of all your archives going forward.</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-2-create-project-folders\">STEP 2: Create Project Folders</h4>\n<p>For the second step, start by creating a new folder called “Projects.” This will be the official home of all your information related to projects (short-term efforts with a clear end goal) going forward. Inside that new folder, create a subfolder for each one of your active projects and title them with the name of each project.</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-3-create-additional-folders-as-needed\">STEP 3: Create Additional Folders as Needed</h4>\n<p>never create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it.</p>\n<p>follow the same three steps above with your cloud storage drive, notetaking app, and anywhere else you store information,\n<em><strong>Note:</strong> email, paper, photos, screenshots?</em></p>\n<p>Think carefully about what you want to save in all four categories of PARA. What is truly unique or useful? What do you need in front of you when you sit down to focus on a project or area? Which resources are truly valuable, and which could you easily find again with a Google search?\n<em><strong>Tags:</strong> reflection</em></p>\n<h3 id=\"4-five-key-tips-for-making-organizing-easy\">4 Five Key Tips for Making Organizing Easy</h3>\n<h4 id=\"tip-1-create-an-inbox\">TIP #1: Create an Inbox</h4>\n<p>you need a separate time and place to “process” new items. I recommend creating an additional, fifth folder alongside the four we’ve already covered, on each major platform you use (such as your Documents folder, cloud storage drive, and notetaking app) with the title “Inbox.”</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-2-number-the-folders\">TIP #2: Number the Folders</h4>\n<p>I suggest adding the numbers 0–4 at the beginning of the titles for each of the five folders you now have. Using “0” for the inbox reminds you that its contents have not yet been processed. This keeps them in the right order from most to least actionable when they are sorted alphabetically.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-3-use-a-naming-convention\">TIP #3: Use a Naming Convention</h4>\n<p>It’s helpful if you can see a folder—on any platform, on any device—and instantly know which of the four main PARA categories it is in. I like to use an informal naming convention to make this possible, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders</li>\n<li>Capitalized titles for area folders</li>\n<li>Uncapitalized titles for resource folders</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"tip-4-activate-offline-mode\">TIP #4: Activate Offline Mode</h4>\n<p>activate offline mode for just the Projects folder (and its subfolders) on each device you use while traveling, in transit, or when you just want to shut off the Wi-Fi and focus.</p>\n<h4 id=\"tip-5-make-backups\">TIP #5: Make Backups</h4>\n<h3 id=\"5-how-to-maintain-your-para-system\">5 How to Maintain Your PARA System</h3>\n<p>do all the upkeep of your PARA system in just five minutes per week. All you need to do is follow these three easy steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Retitle new items in your inbox</li>\n<li>Sort new items into PARA folders</li>\n<li>Update your active projects</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"step-1-retitle-new-items-in-your-inbox\">STEP #1: Retitle New Items in Your Inbox</h4>\n<p>giving each item the shortest, simplest, easiest-to-understand title I can think of within a few seconds.</p>\n<p>Note that you likely have several inboxes you’ll need to do this for, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>An inbox you’ve created in your Documents folder (recommended in chapter 4)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An inbox for your cloud storage drive</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An inbox in your digital notetaking app</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> email, paper, photos, screenshots?</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"step-2-sort-new-items-into-para-folders\">STEP #2: Sort New Items into PARA Folders</h4>\n<p>I also find that briefly revisiting new information I’ve captured over the last week serves as a helpful reminder of any follow-up actions I need to take.</p>\n<h4 id=\"step-3-update-your-active-projects\">STEP #3: Update Your Active Projects</h4>\n<p>take a look at your project folders and make changes to reflect what’s happened over the past week. This could include actions such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the name of a project to reflect a new scope or direction</li>\n<li>Splitting a large project into smaller ones to make it more achievable</li>\n<li>Archiving a project that has been completed, put on hold, canceled, or handed over to someone else</li>\n<li>Unarchiving a dormant project that has since become active again and moving it back to the Projects folder</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before archiving a project, scan it briefly for any material (such as brainstorms, background research, slides, interview notes, etc.) that might be relevant to other pursuits and move these items to the appropriate place within PARA.</p>\n<p>The Archive should be your starting point any time you launch a new project, do a personal year-end review, or update your résumé for a new job. It contains the supporting evidence you’ll need to successfully advocate for a raise or promotion, pitch a new client, or propose a bold new venture.</p>\n<h2 id=\"part-2-the-para-playbook\">PART 2 THE PARA PLAYBOOK</h2>\n<h3 id=\"6-how-to-distinguish-between-projects-and-areas\">6 How to Distinguish between Projects and Areas</h3>\n<p>My definition of a <strong>project</strong> is any endeavor that has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A goal that will enable you to mark it “complete”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An <strong>area</strong> of responsibility has:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A standard to be maintained</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An indefinite end date</p>\n<p><em><strong>Tags:</strong> definition</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You also have areas of responsibility in your personal life, like your health, finances, personal development, and relationships,</p>\n<p>To put it simply: projects end, while areas continue indefinitely.\n<em><strong>Note:</strong> it seems the project goal/date and area standards should be uniformly included somewhere in the system. 0 file? Title?</em></p>\n<p>Every project typically falls under an area of responsibility.</p>\n<p>I’ve noticed most people tend to favor either projects or areas in the way they lead their lives. &hellip; Once you view your life through the lens of projects and areas, it becomes very clear that you need both: sprints to ramp up something new, and marathons to sustain it.</p>\n<h3 id=\"7-how-to-distinguish-between-areas-and-resources\">7 How to Distinguish between Areas and Resources</h3>\n<p>there is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in.

It has just about the right blend of \"friction\" and \"flow\", meaning that it is not so easy to use that it leads to overcommitment and overwhelm, nor so hard to use that I avoid it or feel overly slowed down.\n\nThe ability to easily restart (without losing anything) is a huge plus for those of us who feel the frequent temptation of starting over or trying new systems. The aforementioned sweet spot also helps prevent system switch.\n\nThe one thing I don't feel like it satisfactorily addresses is \"in which of my places is that Inbox, Project, Area, Resource, or Archive?\". I'm tempted to make one storage location my \"main\" with some sort of index, but don't want to overwhelm the system. *How have you addressed this?*\n\n---\n# My Reading Highlights and Notes\n\n## INTRODUCTION How to Read This Book\n\nPROMISE #1: You will stop wasting time looking for information: You will know exactly where your most important notes and documents live, and how to find them in seconds.\n\nPROMISE #2: You will gain greater focus on what matters most: You will have greater clarity about what’s important so you can intentionally move your life into alignment with your interests and goals.\n\nPROMISE #3: You will make things happen: You will consistently finish what you start, beating procrastination and tapping into your past learning to make progress fast.\n\nPROMISE #4: Your creativity and productivity will soar: You will have access to a playground of your own ideas to finally do the creative work that’s been locked up inside you.\n\nPROMISE #5: You will beat information overload and FOMO: The fear of missing out on a key piece of information will disappear and be replaced with the confidence that you have everything you need to get started.\n\n## PART 1 THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PARA\n\n### 1 Introducing PARA\n\nSuch a system would need to be incredibly easy to set up, and even easier to maintain. After all, only the simplest, most frictionless habits endure long term.\n\t***Note:** yet there is value in friction re: recall and evaluation. How to manage this tension?*\n\nuse it in every one of the many places where you store information.\n\t***Note:** OK, but how do I know which one it lives in? (this does not get answered satisfactorily.)*\n\nWhether you want to save excerpts from a book you’re reading,\n\t***Note:** Seems like overkill if you make a lot of highlights...but then again, maybe they should go in 04 Archive if they are not useful.*\n\nYou have __projects__ you’re actively working on—short-term efforts (whether in your work or personal life) that you take on with a certain goal in mind.\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nYou have areas of __responsibility__—important parts of your work and life that require ongoing attention more broadly.\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nThen you have __resources__ on a range of topics you’re interested in and learning about,\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nFinally, you have __archives__, which include anything from the previous three categories that is no longer active but you might want to save for future reference:\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nThe system you use to organize information has to be so simple that it frees up your attention, instead of taking more of it. Your system must give you time, not take time.\n\n### 2 The Power of Organizing by Project\n\nthere are two critical things you cannot do until you break down your areas of responsibility into specific, concrete projects.\n\nOBSTACLE #1: You Can’t Truly Know the Extent of Your Commitments\n\nOBSTACLE #2: You Can’t Connect Your Current Efforts to Your Long-Term Goals\n\nWhat does our motivation depend on? Mostly, on making consistent progress. We can endure quite a bit of stress and frustration in the short term if we know it’s leading somewhere.\n\nwithout a list of individual projects, you can’t connect your current efforts to your long-term goals.\n\nWhen you break down your responsibilities into bite-size projects, you ensure that your project list is constantly turning over. This turnover creates a cadence of regular victories that you get to celebrate every time you successfully complete a project.\n\nUsing PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go. It is about organizing information in such a way that it supports and calls into being the future life you want to lead.\n\n### 3 The Sixty-Second PARA Setup Guide\n\nStep 1: Archive existing files\nStep 2: Create project folders\nStep 3: Create additional folders as needed\n\n#### STEP 1: Archive Existing Files\n\nThe problem with keeping everything is that it quickly starts to consume a resource even more scarce than physical space: your attention.\n\t***Tags:** favorite*\n\nselect all the existing files, documents, folders, notes, etc. in your Documents folder (which may number in the hundreds or even thousands or more) and move them all at once into a new folder called “Archive [Today’s date].”\n\nThen, place this new dated archive folder inside another, larger folder titled simply “Archives,” which will be the official home of all your archives going forward.\n\n#### STEP 2: Create Project Folders\n\nFor the second step, start by creating a new folder called “Projects.” This will be the official home of all your information related to projects (short-term efforts with a clear end goal) going forward. Inside that new folder, create a subfolder for each one of your active projects and title them with the name of each project.\n\n#### STEP 3: Create Additional Folders as Needed\n\nnever create an empty folder (or tag, or directory, or other container) before you have something to put in it.\n\nfollow the same three steps above with your cloud storage drive, notetaking app, and anywhere else you store information,\n\t***Note:** email, paper, photos, screenshots?*\n\nThink carefully about what you want to save in all four categories of PARA. What is truly unique or useful? What do you need in front of you when you sit down to focus on a project or area? Which resources are truly valuable, and which could you easily find again with a Google search?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\n### 4 Five Key Tips for Making Organizing Easy\n\n#### TIP #1: Create an Inbox\n\nyou need a separate time and place to “process” new items. I recommend creating an additional, fifth folder alongside the four we’ve already covered, on each major platform you use (such as your Documents folder, cloud storage drive, and notetaking app) with the title “Inbox.”\n\n#### TIP #2: Number the Folders\n\nI suggest adding the numbers 0–4 at the beginning of the titles for each of the five folders you now have. Using “0” for the inbox reminds you that its contents have not yet been processed. This keeps them in the right order from most to least actionable when they are sorted alphabetically.\n\n#### TIP #3: Use a Naming Convention\n\nIt’s helpful if you can see a folder—on any platform, on any device—and instantly know which of the four main PARA categories it is in. I like to use an informal naming convention to make this possible, such as:\n\n* Emojis at the beginning of titles for project folders\n* Capitalized titles for area folders\n* Uncapitalized titles for resource folders\n\n#### TIP #4: Activate Offline Mode\n\nactivate offline mode for just the Projects folder (and its subfolders) on each device you use while traveling, in transit, or when you just want to shut off the Wi-Fi and focus.\n\n#### TIP #5: Make Backups\n\n### 5 How to Maintain Your PARA System\n\ndo all the upkeep of your PARA system in just five minutes per week. All you need to do is follow these three easy steps:\n\n* Retitle new items in your inbox\n* Sort new items into PARA folders\n* Update your active projects\n\n#### STEP #1: Retitle New Items in Your Inbox\n\ngiving each item the shortest, simplest, easiest-to-understand title I can think of within a few seconds.\n\nNote that you likely have several inboxes you’ll need to do this for, such as:\n\n* An inbox you’ve created in your Documents folder (recommended in chapter 4)\n* An inbox for your cloud storage drive\n* An inbox in your digital notetaking app\n\n\t***Note:** email, paper, photos, screenshots?*\n\n#### STEP #2: Sort New Items into PARA Folders\n\nI also find that briefly revisiting new information I’ve captured over the last week serves as a helpful reminder of any follow-up actions I need to take.\n\n#### STEP #3: Update Your Active Projects\n\ntake a look at your project folders and make changes to reflect what’s happened over the past week. This could include actions such as:\n\n* Changing the name of a project to reflect a new scope or direction\n* Splitting a large project into smaller ones to make it more achievable\n* Archiving a project that has been completed, put on hold, canceled, or handed over to someone else\n* Unarchiving a dormant project that has since become active again and moving it back to the Projects folder\n\nBefore archiving a project, scan it briefly for any material (such as brainstorms, background research, slides, interview notes, etc.) that might be relevant to other pursuits and move these items to the appropriate place within PARA.\n\nThe Archive should be your starting point any time you launch a new project, do a personal year-end review, or update your résumé for a new job. It contains the supporting evidence you’ll need to successfully advocate for a raise or promotion, pitch a new client, or propose a bold new venture.\n\n## PART 2 THE PARA PLAYBOOK\n\n### 6 How to Distinguish between Projects and Areas\n\nMy definition of a __project__ is any endeavor that has:\n\n* A goal that will enable you to mark it “complete”\n* A deadline or timeframe by which you’d like it done\n\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nAn __area__ of responsibility has:\n\n* A standard to be maintained\n* An indefinite end date\n\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\n\nYou also have areas of responsibility in your personal life, like your health, finances, personal development, and relationships,\n\nTo put it simply: projects end, while areas continue indefinitely.\n\t***Note:** it seems the project goal/date and area standards should be uniformly included somewhere in the system. 0 file? Title?*\n\nEvery project typically falls under an area of responsibility.\n\nI’ve noticed most people tend to favor either projects or areas in the way they lead their lives. ... Once you view your life through the lens of projects and areas, it becomes very clear that you need both: sprints to ramp up something new, and marathons to sustain it.\n\n### 7 How to Distinguish between Areas and Resources\n\nthere is a big difference between things you are directly responsible for and things you are merely interested in. I use uppercase titles for areas and lowercase titles for resources to constantly remind myself that one is more important than the other.\n\n__Areas__ are parts of our lives that require ongoing attention to uphold a certain level of quality or performance. It’s helpful to think of them as the “roles you play” or the “hats you wear” at work and in life.\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\n__Resources__ encompass the vast number of things you might be interested in, curious about, or passionate about at any given time.\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\nInstead of asking, “Is this interesting?” which always results in overcollecting, I ask myself, __“Is this useful?”__ That’s a much higher bar and forces me to consider what this piece of information will allow me to do that I couldn’t do otherwise, which problem it could help me solve, or which obstacle it might help me overcome.\n\t***Tags:** favorite*\n\nAreas Are Private Whereas Resources Are Shareable\n\nTherefore, I recommend you think of your resource folders as “shareable by default.” That way you can share individual documents (or even entire folders) with others on the fly, without first having to comb through them for any personal details.\n\t***Note:** these should go in a different place, then, where they cannot be accidentally shared (via backlinks, etc.)*\n\nWe’ve all done it—some area of our lives feels too complex, uncertain, or confronting, so we throw ourselves at something else to take our mind off it. It feels great at first, distracting ourselves from pressing problems in favor of an exciting new hobby or research interest.\n\n### 8 Extending PARA across Multiple Platforms\n\nTechnology is advancing too quickly on too many fronts for any one app to fulfill every need. Instead of fighting the tide and looking for “one app to rule them all,” use as many apps as you like, while replicating the same structure across every single one. I recommend doing so down to the exact same spelling, punctuation, and capitalization so that you can mentally transition between platforms as seamlessly as possible.\n\nI use the following rules of thumb to tell me which digital storage medium is best for any given piece of information:\n\n* If it’s an appointment or meeting happening at a specific time, it goes on my calendar\n* If it’s a task that I can complete anytime, it goes in my to-do list app\n* If it’s text, it goes in my notetaking app (since that offers the best search function by which to find it again)\n* If it’s content that I’ll be collaborating on with others, it goes in my cloud storage drive\n* If it can’t go in any of the above locations (because it’s too large or a specialized file type, for example), then it goes in my computer’s file system (the Documents folder)\n\nyou should create a folder on any platform only when you have something to put in it.\n\nThe landscape of productivity software is always changing, but that doesn’t mean your organizing methods have to be. If a feature you depend on stops working, or the policies or pricing of a platform unexpectedly change, that affects only one platform. With PARA, any risk or vulnerability is limited to just one part of your digital life and doesn’t automatically knock out all the others.\n\n### 9 Keep Information Flowing\n\nOne final note: though my preferred method is to move notes and files wholesale from one place to another, you actually have four options for how to associate an existing piece of information with a new category:\n\n* Moving a single item (if only one item is relevant to a new project, for example)\n* Moving a folder full of items (if a whole group of items is relevant)\n* Linking two items together (if you want to keep the original item where it is)\n* Tagging items with the same tag (if you want to associate many items with each other without moving them)\n\nThe only action I recommend avoiding at all costs is duplication: you never want to have two versions of a file or document, because then you never know which one is the most current.\n\n### 10 Using PARA with a Team\n\nIt takes a lot of time and effort to articulate one’s knowledge in a form that can be understood by others. Since most staff aren’t compensated or evaluated for that effort, it always tends to fall by the wayside.\n\n#### RECOMMENDATION #1: Get clear on your organization’s flavor of PARA\n\nI suggest creating a “PARA Playbook” for your team that includes decisions such as:\n\n* What is our definition of a “project,” “area of responsibility,” “resource,” and “archive”?\n* What needs to happen when we kick off a new project for it to be considered “active”?\n* What needs to happen when a project gets completed, put on hold, or canceled (to be considered “inactive”)?\n* What are the officially supported platforms on which PARA will be used?\n* What are the rules, guidelines, and norms that govern how people will use PARA?\n* Who will be the “PARA Champion” who oversees its implementation and makes sure the guidelines are being followed?\n\n#### RECOMMENDATION #2: Train people in how to use PARA\n\nyou will need to teach your people not only how PARA works, but how it works for your team.\n\n#### RECOMMENDATION #3: Keep only shared projects on shared platforms\n\nit takes a tremendous amount of cognitive effort to effectively communicate a piece of knowledge.\n\nI recommend advising your team to keep all their personal notes, files, and documents in their personal PARA system by default. Only when a project, area, or resource becomes collaborative, with multiple people involved, should it be moved to the shared folders in a company-wide PARA system.\n\n#### RECOMMENDATION #4: Encourage a culture of writing\n\nA high-quality piece of communication meets the following criteria:\n\n* Is it interesting and attention-grabbing? (Does it make people want to read it?)\n* Is it precise and clear? (Can people easily understand what it’s trying to say?)\n* Is it empathetic? (Is it written to be understood from the reader’s point of view?)\n* Does it help people solve a problem? (Is it clearly useful and effective?)\n* Does it inspire people to take action? (Does it make it easy for others to apply it?)\n\n\t***Tags:** favorite*\n\nSet an example: Senior leadership and managers can set an example by regularly sharing their most important ideas and decisions in writing\n\nOffer incentives: Staff at all levels can be rewarded and praised when they take the time to express their thinking in writing\n\nProvide feedback: Direct reports can be offered private feedback on their writing drafts before sharing them more widely\n\nSet aside time for reading: Meetings can begin with “reading time” to emphasize that the context for discussions is best absorbed in written form\n\nStandardize: Adopt a standard term for an internal piece of writing (such as a memo, proposal, one-pager, or article) and create a standard template (such as a Google Doc or Notion page) for doing so\n\n## PART 3 DEEP DIVES\n\n### 11 Creating a Project List\n\nYour __Project__ List is a list of the outcomes you are currently committed to achieving, all in one place. It is an inventory of all the things you’re trying to produce, create, accomplish, or resolve. It’s like a to-do list, but on a bigger scale and longer time horizon so you can tell where you’re headed. It’s like a list of goals, but more practical and rooted in the here and now.\n\t***Tags:** definition*\n\n#### STEP #1: List Your Current Projects\n\nSet a timer for five minutes (which is enough for a “first pass”) and write down anything that comes to mind when you read the following questions, whether they are work-related or personal:\n\nWhat’s currently worrying you? What problem is taking more mental bandwidth than it deserves? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on? What actions are you already taking that are part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What would you like to learn, develop, build, express, pursue, start, explore, or play with? Which skills would you like to learn and which hobbies would you like to start? What kind of project could advance your career or make your life more fun or interesting?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\n#### STEP #2: Add a Goal for Each Project\n\nTake a minute and add a goal for each project on your list in parentheses.\n\n#### STEP #3: Add Deadlines or Timeframes\n\nNext, go through the list one more time and add completion dates. Don’t get hung up on whether this is a strict “deadline” or simply the date by which you prefer to have it done. You can add dates to each item on your list by adding “by…” at the end.\n\n#### STEP #4: Prioritize Your List\n\nThe key here is to prioritize only for the upcoming week.\n\nFor just next week, which projects should be taking up most of your mental bandwidth? Put those at the top. Which ones should be taking up little or none of your bandwidth next week? Put those at the bottom.\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\nYour only goal in a given week is to make progress on a handful of projects near the top of that list.\n\n#### STEP #5: Reevaluate Your Project List\n\nNow that you have a full inventory of everything you’re committed to this week, you have the chance to ask some difficult but incredibly illuminating questions of yourself:\n\nWhich goals or priorities you say are important to you don’t have any projects associated with them? (These are called “dreams,” since they aren’t likely to happen in the near term.) Which projects you’re spending a lot of time on don’t have any goals associated with them? (These are called “hobbies,” because without a goal in mind, they are likely “just for fun.”) Which projects can you cancel, postpone, reduce in scope, delegate, outsource, or clarify?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\nThe five steps I’ve just taken you through can become part of a “weekly review.” You can walk through them once a week, or anytime you feel overwhelmed or stretched too thin, and I guarantee you’ll emerge in minutes with a newfound sense of clarity and purpose.\n\n### 12 The Three Core Habits of Organization\n\nWe know our memories are weak, so we outsource remembering to technology as insurance against that fact.\n\nThe only thing that will remain is the habits you adopt or change\n\n#### HABIT #1: Organize According to Outcomes\n\nalways begin with the end in mind and work backward to decide only which information you’ll need to get there, and push everything else aside.\n\n#### HABIT #2: Organize Just in Time\n\norganizing by itself doesn’t add value. It has no inherent worth unless it puts you in a state of mind for taking effective action.\n\n#### HABIT #3: Keep Things Informal\n\nPARA requires precision in only one place: the definition of projects. Everything else is not only allowed to remain somewhat messy;\n\nAllowing some messiness and randomness into the system creates opportunities for very different ideas to be connected and intermixed.\n\nOrganizing ideas according to outcomes ensures you’re actively testing them in the real world. Organizing just in time preserves your time and energy so you can pursue unexpected opportunities. And keeping things informal by default allows novel connections and patterns to form.\n\n### 13 Using PARA to Enhance Focus, Creativity, and Perspective\n\nCollecting information is easy, and we’ve seen that filing it away isn’t that hard either. But if you stop there, all this effort amounts to hoarding. Value doesn’t come from the inputs; it comes from your outputs, bearing your signature and style.\n\nIt’s helpful to think of each main category of PARA as a “horizon.” Your projects exist on a short-term horizon that will play out in the coming hours or days. Your areas of responsibility and resources play out on a medium-term horizon over weeks and months. Your archives are more likely to be useful on a long-term horizon of months or years.\n\nThese are the kinds of questions that are relevant on this short-term horizon: Which projects are most active right now? Which tasks are most time-sensitive? What are the next steps you need to take to move them forward? What information do you need access to in order to do so?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\nAt these times of deeper reflection, ask yourself these questions: What is the standard (of quality or performance) I’m committed to in each of my areas of responsibility? Am I currently meeting that standard? If not, are there any new projects, habits, routines, or other practices I can start, stop, or change? Are there any resources that would enable me to do so?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\nWhen evaluating your resources, ask yourself questions like: Are there any new interests or passions I’d like to pursue more seriously? Are there any curiosities or questions I’d like to start exploring? Are there any hobbies or pursuits I’ve allowed to stagnate that I’d like to reboot?\n\t***Tags:** reflection*\n\n### 14 When in Doubt, Start Over\n\nIf you ever get stuck or feel overwhelmed, simply archive everything and start over following the instructions I provided in chapter 3.\n\nthe act of declaring “digital bankruptcy” is an escape hatch that you can use anytime your digital world starts to become too chaotic and suffocating. I’ve done it countless times, and every time it fills me with a sense of relief and enthusiasm for what’s next.\n\nWhen it comes to your finances, there are serious consequences to declaring bankruptcy. But not in the digital world. There is no downside to archiving everything because it will all remain available in the future.\n\n### 15 Organizing as Personal Growth\n\nBy surrounding yourself with information that provokes a feeling of fascination, you’ll begin to harness the incredible enthusiasm for learning and growth you have trapped inside.\n\nPower comes from systems that don’t depend on your energy levels, attention span, or self-discipline. That’s why PARA asks you to make one decision for each piece of information, and one decision only: When will this be relevant next?\n\nDon’t create a bunch of aspirational projects and goals that are merely wishful thinking.\n\nWisdom Worker.\n",

				"content_text": "\n100,000 [scrobbles](https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams)!\n\nThat means I've listened to **at least** that many songs since I started recording my listening history in 2008[^0].\n\nLet's have a look at my top **Artists**, **Albums**, and **Tracks**. [^1] [^2]\n\n## Artists\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2024/100k-listens-9-artists.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n1. Klayton ([Celldweller](https://www.last.fm/music/Celldweller), [Circle of Dust](https://www.last.fm/music/Circle+of+Dust), [Argyle Park](https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle+Park), [Criss Angel](https://www.last.fm/music/Criss+Angel), [Ap2](https://www.last.fm/music/Ap2), [Brainchild](https://www.last.fm/music/Brainchild) and more) (3500+ plays): a talented multi-instrumentalist with a variety of excellent industrial-adjacent projects. \n3. Rhys Fulber ([Front Line Assembly](https://www.last.fm/music/Front+Line+Assembly), [Delerium](https://www.last.fm/music/Delerium), [Fear Factory](https://www.last.fm/music/Fear+Factory), [Noise Unit](https://www.last.fm/music/Noise+Unit), [Rhys Fulber](https://www.last.fm/music/Rhys+Fulber) and more) (2700): multi-genre electronic musician, producer, and remixer. \n4. [August Burns Red](https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red) (1500): technical metalcore from Manheim, PA\n5. [In the Midst of Lions](https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions) (1300): most-likely my introduction to deathcore, and still one of my faves \n6. [For Today](https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today) (1200): unrelenting metalcore with a message\n7. [Nine Inch Nails](https://www.last.fm/music/Nine+Inch+Nails) (1100): what could I say that you don't already know?\n8. [KMFDM](https://www.last.fm/music/KMFDM) (1100): the industrial rock giants\n9. [Haste The Day](https://www.last.fm/music/Haste+The+Day) (1000): local metalcore with some boppy anthems\n10. [Opeth](https://www.last.fm/music/Opeth) (1000): progressive death metal and prog rock\n11. [Juno Reactor](https://www.last.fm/music/Juno+Reactor) (900): genre-bending psytrance that you may know from Matrix soundtracks\n\nTogether, these top artists still only account for roughly 15% of my listening. Check [\"artists\" on my profile](https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams/library/artists) if you want to see more of the others.\n\n## Albums\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2024/100k-songs-9-albums.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n1. [In the Midst of Lions](https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions) - [The Heart of Man](https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions/The+Heart+of+Man): I listened to this over and over when I commuted downtown 1 or 2 times a week. You can still catch me or my spouse belting out an epic growl of \"Brood of Vipers!\" from _The Pharisaic Heart_.\n2. [For Today](https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today) - [Breaker](https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today/Breaker): Energetic & hard-hitting without a dud on the entire album.\n3. [The Crimson Armada](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada) - [Conviction](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada/Conviction): Technical deathcore with choruses that beg you to sing along.\n4. [August Burns Red](https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red) - [Constellations](https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/Constellations): This was the album that got me hooked on ABR.\n5. [Broken Note](https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note) - [Terminal Static](https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note/Terminal+Static): Grimy industrial dubs. One of many groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.\n6. [Zao](https://www.last.fm/music/Zao) - [Where Blood and Fire Bring Rest](https://www.last.fm/music/Zao/Where+Blood+and+Fire+Bring+Rest): Not only one of my top-listened albums, but surely one of the best, as well. Incredible genre-defining metalcore. I even have the album cover as art.\n7. [Katatonia](https://www.last.fm/music/Katatonia) - [Dethroned & Uncrowned](https://www.last.fm/music/Katatonia/Dethroned+&+Uncrowned): The clever title for this soft[^3] version of their _Dead End Kings_ album alone makes it worth a listen, but I find myself melancholically singing along to almost every track.\n8. [DJ Hidden](https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Hidden) - [The Later After](https://www.last.fm/music/DJ+Hidden/The+Later+After): Threatening atmospheric drum & bass, darkstep. Another of the groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.\n9. [Celldweller](https://www.last.fm/music/Celldweller) - [Wish Upon A Blackstar](https://www.last.fm/music/Celldweller/Wish+Upon+A+Blackstar): This is the moment Klayton hit his stride in creating albums as complete concepts.\n10. [Flesh Field](https://www.last.fm/music/Flesh+Field) - [Strain](https://www.last.fm/music/Flesh+Field/Strain): To me, this is the most iconic sound of the \"core\" of industrial music. I really appreciate the drums, programming, and contrasting voices in this album.\n\n*Edit*: I made a glaring omission! The next album would have come in #3 if I had included the different editions as one.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2024/misguided.webp\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\">\n\n[Argyle Park](https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle+Park \"Argyle Park\") - [Misguided](https://www.last.fm/music/Argyle+Park/Misguided+(Remastered)+%5BDeluxe+Edition%5D \"Misguided (Remastered) [Deluxe Edition]\"): this was a super-controversial, way-ahead-of-its time album. It included people from Klayton's musical circles, including his common collaborators (lvl, buka, Klank); Mark Salomon (of Stavesacre, the Crucified, Chatterbox, etc.); and others in the scene like Jyro (Mortal), J.G. Thirlwell (Foetus), Tommy Victor (Prong), and Lauren Boquette (Drown, Six). It's a one-of-a-kind album.\n\n## Tracks\n\n1. [In the Midst of Lions](https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions) - [The Machine](https://www.last.fm/music/In+the+Midst+of+Lions/_/The+Machine): I dare you to listen to this an never let out your own \"stop...the machine!\"\n2. [For Today](https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today) - [Devastator](https://www.last.fm/music/For+Today/_/Devastator): Same as above, but with \"tear it to the ground!\"\n3. [Igorrr](https://www.last.fm/music/Igorrr) - [Double Monk](https://www.last.fm/music/Igorrr/_/Double+Monk): This was one of those songs that threatened my understanding of a what a \"song\" could be (Igorrr has a way of doing that). This is one of those few songs that I've put on a single-song loop. Also, from another of the groundbreaking breakcore-ish albums from the Ad Noiseam label.\n4. [The Crimson Armada](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada) - [Juggernaut](https://www.last.fm/music/The+Crimson+Armada/_/Juggernaut): I love all the contrasting vocal and instrumental elements that make the story of this song work so well. \"You can rip out my tongue / And I'll speak of His love. / You can pry out my eyes / And I'll show off His love  / You can tear off my flesh / I'll share the warmth of his love\".\n5. [August Burns Red](https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red) - [White Washed](https://www.last.fm/music/August+Burns+Red/_/White+Washed): I just love the sound of this one, honestly. (I think it may be about an argument between them and a straightedge band.)\n6. [Broken Note](https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note) - [Mask of Gas](https://www.last.fm/music/Broken+Note/_/Mask+of+Gas): this track feels like a industrial warehouse dance-off with electronic and hip-hop groups.\n7. [Living Sacrifice](https://www.last.fm/music/Living+Sacrifice) - [Bloodwork](https://www.last.fm/music/Living+Sacrifice/_/Bloodwork): this is from my favorite era of LS. Two percussionists. The guitars were percussion. The vocals were percussion. Everything was percussion! What a fun track and album.\n8. [Drumcorps](https://www.last.fm/music/Drumcorps) - [Down](https://www.last.fm/music/Drumcorps/_/Down): Like Igorrr's track above, this was one of those songs that threatened my understanding of a what a \"song\" could be (and is yet another from a groundbreaking breakcore-ish album from the Ad Noiseam label).\n9. [Haste The Day](https://www.last.fm/music/Haste+The+Day) - [When Everything Falls](https://www.last.fm/music/Haste+The+Day/_/When+Everything+Falls): remember when I said that this metalcore band had some boppy anthems? (also, it's a great way to end a show/concert/festival. [e.g.](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2023/09/24/perfect-ending-to.html))\n10. [Flobots](https://www.last.fm/music/Flobots) - [Stand Up](https://www.last.fm/music/Flobots/_/Stand+Up): This was one of the tracks that introduced me to the social, lyrical, and musical depth of Flobots.\n\n## Your Turn\n\nTell me about your faves?

Subversion doesn’t suit people who, feeling their adjustment to life has been successful, want things to go on just as they are, or people who need support from authority assuring them that things are as they have to be. Fantasy not only asks “What if things didn’t go on just as they do?” but demonstrates what they might be like if they went otherwise—thus gnawing at the very foundation of the belief that things have to be the way they are.&quot; (Ursula K.

				"content_html": "<p><em>This is a post is in the <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/\">Useful Ideas</a> series.</em></p>\n<p>This is a framework to guide organizational design decisions, based on three directions: <em>inside-out</em>, <em>outside-in</em>, and <em>upwards</em>. Most of us tend to primarily consider one of these directions, so  this framework helps us to evaluate the <em>other</em> directions, as well.</p>\n<p>As you evaluate these factors, there will be tradeoffs to make, but considering each of these directions helps you to make <strong>informed</strong> tradeoffs and to <strong>mitigate</strong> the downsides of your approach.</p>\n<p>For each direction, I&rsquo;ll give a brief glimpse of an org design that highly prioritizes that perspective often at the expense of the other perspectives.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I believe these principles are relevant to many types of organizations. However, I chose to use consistent and simplified language where possible.

				"content_text": "*This is a post is in the [Useful Ideas](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/useful-ideas/) series.*\n\nThis is a framework to guide organizational design decisions, based on three directions: *inside-out*, *outside-in*, and *upwards*. Most of us tend to primarily consider one of these directions, so  this framework helps us to evaluate the *other* directions, as well.\n\nAs you evaluate these factors, there will be tradeoffs to make, but considering each of these directions helps you to make **informed** tradeoffs and to **mitigate** the downsides of your approach.\n\nFor each direction, I'll give a brief glimpse of an org design that highly prioritizes that perspective often at the expense of the other perspectives.\n\n*Note: I believe these principles are relevant to many types of organizations. However, I chose to use consistent and simplified language where possible. So, when you see \"customers\", for example, you may need to mentally substitute this with \"stakeholders\", \"boundary partners\", \"constituents\", \"members\", \"clients\" or whatever is the appropriate term for the type of organization you are designing. Do this for other terms, as well.*\n\n## Inside-Out: Delivery\n\nThe inside-out direction focuses on how a team is aligned for delivery. It considers questions such as:\n\n- Is it easy to get quality output & results through the system?\n- Have we limited dependencies so that there are reduced handoffs and waiting?\n- Do we have all the needed skills and competencies within the team?\n- Are roles and responsibilities clear?\n\n*Extreme example: the team is fully self-contained and has a highly-structured production line.*\n\nThe inside-out direction is about creating a structure that supports the execution of the  strategy and the delivery of value to the customers. \n\n## Outside-In: Customers\n\nThe outside-in direction focuses on how customers engage with the organization. It considers questions such as:\n\n- Is it easy for customers to get support?\n- Do customers know where to go for support, and are there limited places to go?\n- Are we building rapport and trust with customers?\n- Are we aligned to anticipate and respond to customer needs and expectations?\n\n*Extreme example: each customer has a personal ambassador to the organization who is fully equipped and empowered to address the customer's needs.*\n\nThe outside-in direction is about creating a customer-centric culture and a customer-oriented structure. \n\n## Upwards: Expertise\n\nThe upwards direction focuses on how team members gain domain knowledge, skill, and ability to troubleshoot. It considers questions such as:\n\n- Do people responsible for delivery get significant exposure to problems?\n- ...and are they incentivized to understand and solve them?\n- Do team members get practice & timely feedback that hones their skill & knowledge?\n- Are we helping people become adept at their craft and greater in wisdom?\n\n*Extreme example: for every offering, team member(s) are responsible for the complete lifecycle from initial design to ongoing support.*\n\nThe upwards direction is about creating a growth-oriented culture and a people-oriented structure.\n\n## Summary\n\nEach direction represents a different perspective on how to align the structure, roles, and competencies of the organization with its strategy, culture, environment, customers, and people. The framework helps to evaluate the tradeoffs and benefits of each direction, and to create a balanced and effective organization.\n",

There are plenty of other ways to go about it. Many—such as land, wealth, commercial, or consumer taxes (any of which can be made more or less progressive)—are considerably more efficient, since creating a bureaucratic apparatus capable of monitoring citizens’ personal affairs to the degree required by an income tax system is itself enormously expensive. But this misses the real point: income tax is supposed to be intrusive and exasperating. It is meant to feel at least a little bit unfair. Like so much of classical liberalism (and contemporary neoliberalism), it is an ingenious political sleight of hand—an expansion of the bureaucratic state that also allows its leaders to pretend to advocate for small government.&quot; (David Graeber, Against Economics)\">\n",

Jesus’s paradigm for God is of a gracious, loving Father who kisses the faces of his sinful, rebellious children, but the seriousness with which he regards evil is so intense that he says it’s better to gouge your own eye out than to objectify women. One thing makes me gush. The other makes me nervous. I’m suspicious of voices that only tell me what I want to hear. \r&10;\r&10;Were it me, I might emphasize one thing, but not the other. I’d conceive of a God who is either never angry or never not angry. A soft, enabling God who doesn’t care enough to stop me from destroying myself, or a God so appalled at my relentless failure that he can’t bear to look at me without retching. But in Jesus, our soul-longings to be known and loved, for an end to evil and injustice are realized in the unfathomable beauty of truly self-sacrificial love.&quot; (Joshua S. Porter, Death to Deconstruction)\">\n",

If you want recommendations that ignore one of those factors, I’m happy to share some other options.\n\nI'm going to use **tags** because those are a fun RPG thing.\n\n- **compatible**: it shares enough in common with D&D-like games that it should be easier to use published adversaries or adventures\n- **credited**: you'll find my name in the credits\n- **light**: it's a rules-light system\n- **played**: I've tried it\n\nHere are the games, in alphabetical order:\n\n- [Beyond the Wall](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/113405/Beyond-the-Wall-and-Other-Adventures?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, has some extra focus on group-building, and a bit more setting & vibe built-in\n- [Cornerstone Fantasy](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/161477/Cornerstone-Fantasy?affiliate_id=21283): **light**, the first of three [Sigil Stone](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse/pub/8026/Sigil-Stone-Publishing?affiliate_id=21283) games on the list, but one that appears will not be getting ongoing support and development\n- [Dichotomy](http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/dichotomy) ([backup link](https://rpggeek.com/rpgitem/123101/dichotomy)): a super-indie game with an interesting angle akin to [Lasers & Feelings](https://johnharper.itch.io/lasers-feelings) or [Arcanum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcanum:_Of_Steamworks_and_Magick_Obscura)\n- [Dominion Rules](http://dominionrules.org/): **played**, a highly-underrated game with several great ideas and tons of potential\n- [Dungeon Crawl Classics](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/101050/Dungeon-Crawl-Classics-RPG-DCC-RPG?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, recommended if you want big time \"old-school\" vibes\n- [Five Torches Deep](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/264584/Five-Torches-Deep?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, **light**, essentially a pared-down 5th edition\n- [Forbidden Lands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/258593/Forbidden-Lands-Core-Game?affiliate_id=21283): strong on open-world play, also with some built-in vibes\n- [Into the Odd](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/399483/Into-the-Odd--Remastered?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, **light**, arguably not strictly-fantasy enough, but usable for lots of play with some table-tweaking\n- [Knave](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/250888/Knave?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, **light**, **played**, top recommendation if you just want to get going with quick play\n- [Maze Rats](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/197158/Maze-Rats?affiliate_id=21283): **light**, **played**, top recommendation for a pickup game with no compatibility needed\n- [Mythic D6](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/243769/MYTHIC-D6-Revised--Expanded?affiliate_id=21283): descendant of the West End Games D6 system (like classic Star Wars)\n- [Pathfinder](https://paizo.com/pathfinder): **compatible**, **played**, recommended if you liked 3rd edition\n- [Torchbearer](https://www.burningwheel.com/torchbearer/): **credited**, **played**, descendant of [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/), recommended for those emphasizing the hard life of adventurers\n- [Vagabonds of Dyfed](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/240583/Vagabonds-of-Dyfed?affiliate_id=21283): **light**, **played**, an interesting mashup of D&D and PbtA roots, which shouldn't really work but kinda does\n- [Warrior Rogue Mage](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/82643/Warrior-Rogue--Mage?affiliate_id=21283): **light**, answers \"what if the core archetypes were the stats?\"\n- [Whitehack](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/432645/whitehack-fourth-edition?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, **played**, top recommendation if you want to run a compatible-but-flexible game that lasts many sessions (e.g. campaign-mode)\n- [Worlds Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number?affiliate_id=21283): **compatible**, recommended for the worldbuilding and adventure-creation tools\n\nAnything I should add to the list? Anything you'd particularly recommend? Leave a [reply](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/).\n\n*Disclaimer: I've used [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?affiliate_id=21283) affiliate links, where relevant.

I prefer it because _not Amazon_ and because it incorporates some data elements **other than ratings** which are useful for describing and finding books. I'm hoping micro.blog's [bookshelves](https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves) feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn't handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we'll see what the future holds.)\n\nI keep my to-read/wishlist as a [Bookshop list](https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd), for ease of sharing and gift-giving.\n\n# The Books\n\nLet's start with the recommended ones, collected in [this Bookshop collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/2022-recommendations-df1ac3a8-3069-4570-bcb2-9cfddd6c9504) or visually: \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2023/6295596f30.png\" alt=\"20222books\" title=\"20222books.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"568\" height=\"600\" />\n\nAnd here are **all** the books I read, individually, and in reading order (within rating): \n\n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ :\n\n- The Six Deaths of the Saint (Into Shadow #3) - Alix E.

I exceeded by book goal (55 out of 53) but missed by pages goal (15,868 out of 17,500). I'll go for 60 books next year, but keep the 17,500 page goal.\n\nSimilar to my normal ratio, I read 63% fiction this year:\n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2023/34e4921f60.png\" alt=\"fiction v nonfiction\" title=\"UntitledImage.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"599\" height=\"228\" />\n\nI continue to add to my _intentionality_ in reading, seeking a variety of voices, formats, styles, etc. With such a long list of things I'd like to read, I'm also trying to be wiser about what I should read _sooner than later_ such as things related to health or permaculture.\n\nHere's to a good year of reading!\n\n\n# Previously 📚:\n\n- [2021](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/01/03/recommendations-reading.html)\n- [2020 Fiction](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/01/02/fiction-review.html) \n- [2020 Nonfiction](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/01/02/nonfiction-review.html)\n- [2019 Fiction](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/01/review-fiction.html)\n- [2019 Nonfiction](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/01/review-nonfiction.html)\n- [2018](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/01/01/book-review.html)\n- [2017](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/03/29/book-recommendations.html)\n\n",

Which laws we want to see created and enforced tend to vary by political leanings.</p>\n<p>Between the FBI &amp; the police, the FBI is more likely to restrain the <strong>powerful</strong>, and the police are more likely to restrain the <strong>less-powerful</strong>. This aligns with the trends of the right and left wings in USAmerican politics. We should not see “surprise” with this alignment.</p>\n<p>Obviously there are <em>many exceptions</em>, and I am no proponent of either party (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/06/02/in-that-order.html\">nor in favor of “punching” in general</a>), but it is directionally true that he rightwing has been more likely to “punch down” towards those in weaker positions (e.g. immigration, poverty, sexuality, etc.) and the leftwing has been more likely to “punch up” towards those with power (e.g. monopoly, environment). <em>(All this despite the fact that people in powerful positions often feel like they are the embattled ones.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: don’t be surprised that there are factions of the right wing calling to defund law enforcement that restrains the powerful.

				"content_text": "I need a hazardous hexmap for a post-apocalyptic science-fantasy-meets-dark-fantasy game I'm developing to play with some friends. I think things like this always end up more interesting when the input of multiple people creates emergent complexity. That's where you come in!\n\n![map v5](https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/7ea58ac115.png)\n\n\n*(I'll make a cleaner version with canonical symbols, once we complete the exercise.)*\n\n\n\n# Rules/Steps\n1. **Reply**: you can send a [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) as a reply to this post, reply on micro.blog (see link below), or reply by email (see link below).\n2. **Place an element**: pick from the menu below (a terrain selection or a point of interest), and give me coordinates for it. I'll place it if it doesn't invalidate one I already placed, and then update the map.\n3. **Two then you**: you only get to take another turn if two other changes have happened since the one you requested.\n\n# Menu\n1. **Terrain** (color): Choose 3 hexes of one terrain type and 1 hex of another terrain type. They must be contiguous (connected) with one another. Assume hexes are 25 miles-ish. I'll need coordinates for all 4. *Note: All hexes will eventually get a terrain.*\n\t1. **Swamp** (green): soggy areas filled with things that lurk, where people scrap together whatever safety they can, often on stilts or in the trees\n\t2. **Wasteland** (purple): radiation, toxic spills, infestation, or other terrible things make this land inhospitable to all but the most resilient of beings\n\t3. **Desert** (orange): whether sand, rock, glass, or worse, people here are often nomadic, seeking out scarce resources wherever they can find them\n\t4. **Mountain** (black): steep, formidable, and buffeted by strong winds, people usually live and move inside, rather than trying to cross them\n\t5. **Archipelago** (teal): the waters are filled with small islands, harsh storms, and predators, and people make their way around in small craft and flotillas\n2. **Point of interest** (letter). Only one of these may exist on a hex. You can place them regardless of if the terrain is chosen already, or not.\n\t1. **Skyship** (S): It looms overhead, slowly making its way across the landscape. *Restriction*: only one on the map. If it is already placed, you may choose this again to move it one hex in any direction.\n\t2. **Metropolis** (M): What could even sustain a population in these horrid lands? Something has, because many are here. *Restriction*: only one per terrain type.\n\t3. **Gathering** (G): There are people here, though in smaller quantity. Maybe permanently as a settlement, maybe temporarily or nomadically.\n\t5. **Conflict** (C): Nobody wants to be here, not even those involved.\n\t6. **Ruin** (R): Wonders from a previous era, for those brave or foolish enough to investigate.\n\t7. **Phenomenon** (P): This strange thing shouldn't exist, and yet reports say it does.\n",

				"content_text": "<p>This post is about how I make the best of <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">Readwise.io</a>, a service that works with your notes and highlights to enhance <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already use Readwise, I highly recommend it! <em>You and I both get a free month with my <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">affiliate code</a>.</em> As you can see, I use Readwise consistently:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/e37a135270.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"343\" /></p>\n<p>I will cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting Things In</strong>: making all your highlights and notes available</li>\n<li><strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>: tips for capture and organizing</li>\n<li><strong>Getting Things Out</strong>: making backups and data available in your notes system</li>\n<li><strong>Working with Ideas</strong>: making the most of your highlights and notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsin\">Getting Things In</h1>\n<p>My first principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Send Everything In</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, I want <em>all</em> my reading notes and highlights to end up in Readwise. I even want to supplement my notes and highlights with those that <em>others</em> are making! The system grows in value as more of your important items are included, both because of your ability to search the content and because of the network effects from different notes being available together. (We’ll explore this more in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>).</p>\n<p>Here are the steps:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1.connectallyourservices\">1. Connect All Your Services</h2>\n<p>Once you have an account, head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a> and turn on connections for any services you use.</p>\n<p>For me, that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all the places I read digital books (Kindle, Apple Books, Libby, and Kobo)</li>\n<li>all the places I read things other than books (Instapaper/Pocket, Twitter, Medium, Web Highlights, <a href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\">Inoreader</a>/<a href=\"https://feedly.com\">Feedly</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> service from Readwise)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might use other services and want to connect other them as well. Some additional examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airr.io\">Airr</a> - podcasts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com\">Shortform</a> - book summaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<em>Side Note:</em> Some of the connectors might even inspire you to try a new service, so Readwise has started partnerships offering discounts on services.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.importotherhighlights\">2. Import Other Highlights</h2>\n<p>Not everything has a connector, yet. Even so, there is still probably an option to get those highlights and notes into Readwise. These options are also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p>For physical books, I use the mobile app (<a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/m88AXbvcygb\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/E0AsXt7lIgb\">Android</a>) and its OCR to import from my notes and highlights. Another alternative is the CSV or Email import option. I <em>always</em> add the location or page # field, because the structure and order of the highlights is often helpful later on (for context, etc.)</p>\n<p>There are other non-connector imports as well, such as pdfs, Scribd, O’Reilly, Google Play Books, and “my clippings” for direct files in your Kindle.</p>\n<p>You might even use the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/api_deets\">API</a> to meet your needs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our API supports creating, fetching, and updating highlights on behalf of the user.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3.getotherpeopleshighlights\">3. Get Other People’s Highlights</h2>\n<p>What if I finished a book a while ago and didn’t take highlights or notes? What if I listened to an audiobook? Maybe I just want to see other Readwise users’ highlights?</p>\n<p>In these cases, you can use the “Supplemental Books” feature, also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: if you connect Goodreads in <strong>Step 1</strong>, everything you finish in Goodreads will automatically get added as a supplemental book in Readwise.</p>\n<p>I do not use Goodreads anymore, so when I finish a non-fiction book where I didn’t take highlights or notes, I head over to the Supplemental Books tab and add the book. If no other Readwise user has made highlights, yet, I make a note in tasks to try again later.</p>\n<p>In later sections, we’ll talk more about how these supplemental books are part of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> some publishers lock down how much you can highlight and export from a book. This is not a Readwise problem, but it does affect Readwise. Just in case I run up against limits, I make a habit not to make really long highlights nor to over-highlight a book. These are generally good practices, anyway, as they limit your highlights to readable sections and just the really good stuff.</p>\n<h1 id=\"makinghighlightsandnotes\">Making Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<p>The second principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Start Simple</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section will includes tips for how to use more advanced highlighting and note-taking features, but you can <em>ignore it entirely</em> or start using the tips as they help you. You might have a finely-honed method that you don’t wan’t to disturb. <em>That’s fine</em>: start there. Come back here went you want to use new features or enhance your process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizing\">Organizing</h2>\n<p>When you’ve highlighted & annotated a long document or book, you’ll automatically have all those notes available to you, whether in the collection on the web, in daily review, or in your exports. But if you’re like me, you’d like to <strong>have a bit more structure</strong>, when you are looking at the overall document highlights.</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>headings</strong> come in.</p>\n<p>Headings allow you to structure your highlights at three different heading levels. A common pattern is to call out a <em>Part</em> as heading level 1, a <em>Chapter</em> as heading level 2, and a <em>Section</em> as heading level 3. Then, you’ll have a nice table-of-contents and structure for your notes.</p>\n<p>To use this organizational structure, add a note of “.h1”, “.h2”, or “.h3” to the highlight that you want to turn into a heading. The period before the “h” tells Readwise to treat your note as a tag, not your commentary, and it then processes the highlight as a heading instead of a normal highlight.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example from <em><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/07/05/finished-reading-lean.html\">Lean Software Development</a></em> where I used heading 1 for chapters and heading 2 for agile Tools and “Try This” activities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/74241a09e2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: I generally avoid using heading 3. It is often too much. Make the choice based on your document and whether you’ll get value out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: this is one area of Readwise that has some bugs remaining. Because the header tags get applied a special way, it’s important to enter the tags accurately and in order as you work through the document. I have some books where the heading structure is messed up and it’s not something you can fix fully in the web app. When this happens, you can delete and re-synch your book or document highlights, but this is a pain if you’ve already edited (with tags, commentary, etc.) the comments within Readwise, or already returned the digital book to the library. Hopefully this is something they are fixing in in the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> experience.</p>\n<p>Want to know more about headings? <a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/\">See their blog post on headings if you would like a more detailed explanation.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2>\n<p>You already learned about a special tag: headings. There’s another special tag: <strong>concatenation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Have you ever found a long chunk of text but really just want parts of it? Concatenation lets you highlight that way. Use “.c1”, “.c2”, “.c3” etc. notes to build a highlight that combines them. Readwise will show ellipses between the parts in the final highlight. (<a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/combine-highlights-on-the-fly/\">Read their blog post about concatenation here</a>)</p>\n<p>Normal tags are created the same way as the special ones: while highlighting, add a “.” note, followed by how you’d like to tag the highlight. For example, I use “.i” for “inbox” and “.d” for “definition”. You don’t have to use shorthand, though! Your tag can be a word (or hyphenated words), but don’t add spaces or you’ll have just completed the tag and started making a normal note.</p>\n<p>Tags will be visible anywhere you are reviewing the tagged highlight, such as during daily review or when reviewing the document. From the web, you can also go to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tags</a> , see your tags, and see all the highlights with that tag.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> as with headings, I recommend you don’t go overboard here. It’s easy to waste a lot of time on tags you won’t use. It’s easy to add them later, so feel free to be sparing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you don’t know you want to tag something while you’re highlighting, but later you decide to in one of these situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you’re reviewing highlights from a document or your daily highlights</li>\n<li>a theme has started to emerge in your highlights</li>\n<li>you’re researching a topic within your notes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s fine! You can easily add tags during daily review (“T” if you like keyboard shortcuts) or when reviewing a document. I do a lot of each of those bullets above. I now use “mental-model”, “health”, “coaching”, “reflection”, “security”, “attention”, “resilient”, and “curious” heavily, but often <em>later, during review</em>.</p>\n<p>Final tip on tags: <strong>tag conversion.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember how I said I use “.d” for definition? Those actually show up in my tags as “definition”, because I converted (merged) the tag. From the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tag view</a>, click the ellipses on a tag and rename, and all once-and-future uses of the old tag will become the become the new tag. So while reading I enter as “.d”, but I get “definition” in my highlights and notes. It’s a nice time-saving trick.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I don’t know if there is a way to undo tag conversion. I don’t see one in the web interface. I’d suggest being double-sure before you go about this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsout\">Getting Things Out</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you’re now an expert at making good highlights, tags, and notes, right? But maybe you have a favorite notes system, or you’re worried about your data. For either (or both) reasons, you’ll want to sync your highlights outside of Readwise.</p>\n<p>The third principle for Readwise, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sync Your Data</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/export\">export page</a>. There, connect your note-taking system(s) of choice, or wherever you’d like your highlights & notes to land. I have the following enabled for various reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evernote</li>\n<li>Obsidian</li>\n<li>Roam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…but you can add others like Notion or RemNote.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: this is one of the other reasons you may not want to go overboard with tags. Once your notes are syncing into one of these systems, you may decide you want to tag within your note system instead of in Readwise. Before you make that call, make sure you understand how your system handles syncs from Readwise. I still use 10–15 tags when highlighting or in Readwise, and then use wiki-style links within my notes system to cross-reference certain topics. (More on that in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>.)</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to backup any important data occasionally (and these highlights and notes are important, or you wouldn’t be making them!). The syncs you setup are a soft backup, but you can make a more direct one via the <em>CSV</em> or <em>Markdown</em> export, as well.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> you can also export just one document as markdown, when you need it. Head to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/everything\">browse</a> and from the dropdown on your document, choose “Export Highlights”.</p>\n<p><em>Another Note:</em> At this time, we cannot export highlights from <em>Supplemental Books</em>. You only get your own highlights. Bummer! There are probably some very good reasons for this, though, such as not getting junk into your notes that you didn’t vet first!</p>\n<h1 id=\"workingwithideas\">Working with Ideas</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you have a collection of highlights and annotations and it’s backed up and available in your notes. So what? It’s no good to you if you don’t do anything with it! With that in mind, I’ll share the ways that I get the most out of what I put in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dailyreview\">Daily Review</h2>\n<p>Here’s my fourth principle for Readwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you’re still building the habit, you can use this common habit-building rule, instead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss Twice in a Row</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Review is the cornerstone of the value I receive from Readwise. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/configure/review\">Head over here to configure your review</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s my basic setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sent every morning at 7</li>\n<li>Max out (15) highlights per day</li>\n<li>Blended old/new recency rate</li>\n<li>Bonus highlights <em>off</em> (I have other good recommendation sources)</li>\n<li>Quality filter <em>off</em> (I’d prefer to fix it)</li>\n<li>“Normal” frequency for books, articles, tweets</li>\n<li>Slightly-lower frequency for “supplemental books”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You, of course, can <strong>tune these settings to suit your needs</strong>. If you’re just building the review habit, you may want to start with fewer highlights, for example, to make it easier to build the habit.</p>\n<p>During the daily review, I’m doing a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increasing retention of key points</li>\n<li>Adding tags when I see themes emerging</li>\n<li>Cleaning up and annotating</li>\n<li>Getting inspiration</li>\n<li>Making the highlights “talk to each other”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Retention (#1) happens naturally through the process, but I accelerate it. When I come across a challenging highlight or something that caught me by surprise, I hit the feedback button and choose “soon” or “later” instead of the default “someday”. This means I’m going to see that highlight again sooner.</p>\n<p>And though my overall review frequencies are balanced, I do sometimes select the dropdown on a highlight and “show this doc more often” (or less often), to tune the amount of highlights I am seeing from a certain book or article.</p>\n<p>I mentioned adding tags (#2) in <strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>. This normally happens when I’m noticing topics that I’m highlighting frequently, or which are becoming a common topic in my reading or research. I am very interested in attention and focus, so I have started tagging items related to those topics. I also read things related to health and longevity, so I have started tagging items with actionable advice. I also have two themes that are very important to me: curiosity and resilience, so I have developed tags related to those. You will come up with your own themes!</p>\n<p>Cleaning up and annotating (#3) can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removing bad or no-longer-useful highlights (using the “discard” button)</li>\n<li>fixing highlight or note errors (it happens, especially if they are ones you put in by hand or OCR, see <strong>Getting Things In</strong>)</li>\n<li>making highlights <em>within</em> the highlights (use double underscores around the part you want to highlight)</li>\n<li>adding new commentary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example would be when I don’t remember the context of a highlight, so I add a short note about what it means (perhaps after visiting the document highlights to see the surrounding highlights and structure).</p>\n<p><em>Tip</em>: Don’t feel bad about discarding highlights, especially from <em>Supplemental Books</em>, where they are someone else’s highlight. Discards don’t fully go away. Your discards go into a category named as such, and can be recovered. I’ve got 1276 discards!</p>\n<p>Regarding inspiration (#4), some highlights will make me want to start a blog post or put a task on my planner/calendar. Let your highlights provoke you!</p>\n<p>The last topic, highlight-collision (#5), is perhaps the most important, and is the reason why I max out my review to 15 highlights. I’m not just reviewing 15 highlights…I’m reviewing 15 highlights <strong>together</strong>. That means great chances for serendipity. Sometimes highlights will reinforce one another. Sometimes they will be in tension. Sometimes they will interact in such a way as to spark a new idea. These are magic moments. Dig in to what you are noticing. Add notes (either in the highlight or in your own system) about their interaction. Write a blog post. Make some art. Invent something. Run with it. <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Feel free to tell me what you learned or created.</a></p>\n<p>If you practice zettelkasten, evergreen notes, or a related system, this moment of <em>organized serendipity</em> is a good time to write connecting comments or notes. I use backlicks in Obsidian to accomplish this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookreview\">Book Review</h2>\n<p>When I’ve completed a work of non-fiction (or even a work of fiction where I took more than a handful of highlights), I like to make sure all my notes are in order. I go back to the web view and check my structure (remember <strong>Headings</strong>?), my highlights, notes, and tags.</p>\n<p>This is a good way to refresh myself of everything in the book, and is a jumpstart on spaced-repetition/retention. I may add <em>Supplemental Highlights</em> if I want to see what others highlighted, too.</p>\n<p>This is also a good time to write a <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/books/\">book</a> review, even if it’s a short one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"playfavorites\">Play Favorites</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed during your daily review, or book review, that you can mark a highlight as a favorite. Go ahead, do it!</p>\n<p>Sunday <strong>Daily Review</strong> collections are special, and will contain only favorites. This is a good way to keep coming back to the highlights that are very meaningful for you. This leads us to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"showyourwork\">Show Your Work</h2>\n<p>You can also let people subscribe to an email with a sampling of your favorites, one or more collections of tags, some combination of these, or <em>all</em> your highlights. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/@toddgrotenhuis\">Mine is set to a weekly broadcast with a sampling from my personal favorites and reflection questions.</a></p>\n<p>But what I like even more than the subscription is the share button. When you are reviewing a highlight, hit the share arrow, and you’ll be presented with a few options to present an elegant version of your highlight, like this highlight I have tagged as “reflection”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/48a152bac3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" /></p>\n<p>I often share this way during the Sunday Favorites <strong>Daily Review</strong> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/sunday-quotes/\">like these</a>). I also find these shares to be a fun way to place a highlight into my notes, especially if I’m collecting a few highlights on a topic.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the notes system where you are highlighting your notes supports it, you can publish your highlights there, as well. <em>All of my highlights are currently public, via Obsidian.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>You’ve hopefully picked up four principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On input: <strong>Send Everything In</strong></li>\n<li>On highlighting: <strong>Start Simple</strong></li>\n<li>On output: <strong>Sync Your Data</strong></li>\n<li>On usage: <strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope these will help you make the most of Readwise and help you with <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This was already very long.

				"content_text": "<p>As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html\">2021 Product &amp; Service Recommendations</a>, I primarily use Plex + Plexamp for listening to music (and Marvis Pro on the go), and track listens in <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams\">Last.fm</a>. I listen to podcasts in Overcast.fm.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover a little bit about my listening habits, then share top albums and top podcasts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"musicoverview\">Music Overview</h1>\n<p>Here’s a rough map of my top genres over the year:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/ebef042eb8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"101\" /></p>\n<p>If none of those genres are of interest to you, you may just want to skip down to podcasts, otherwise you’re going to be scratching your head (or even recoiling) at a bunch of “weird music”.</p>\n<p>And here were the top 20 artists:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/98386352ce.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to last.fm and <a href=\"https://deardestiny.shinyapps.io/tuneR/\">tuneR</a>, I can see that three bands were new to my top 20 this year: clipping., Silent Planet, and Joyhauser.</p>\n<p>I got tuned in to clipping. via a friend on Bandcamp, but as I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/31/recommendations-watching.html\">2021 Watching recommendations</a>, became a fan after watching their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk\">NPR (actually!) Tiny Desk Concert</a>. If you start to watch the video and are like “wait, I know him”, then you’re probably right. <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>Snowpiercer</em>, and <em>Central Park</em> are just a few of Daveed Diggs’s major credits.</p>\n<p>Silent Planet has been a fave of mine for a while, so I’m surprised this was the first time they broke the top 20. In addition to making great music, frontman Garrett Russell is a brilliant lyricist, delving passionately and intelligently into political and spiritual themes. (You may remember <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/24/syllabus-northernfires.html\">I’m slowly working on a readthrough of all the books referenced in just one of their tracks</a>.)</p>\n<p>Joyhauser is simply great thumping beats for when you need to focus or keep moving.</p>\n<h1 id=\"albums\">Albums</h1>\n<p>Unlike my other reviews, I restricted my specific album recommendations to ones that were released this year, so as to not have an overwhelming list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onbandcamp\">On Bandcamp</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aquilus.bandcamp.com/album/bellum-i\">Aquilus - Bellum I</a>: black metal, neo-folk</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boysnoize.bandcamp.com/album/-\">Boys Noize - +/-</a>: techno, industrial</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/wriggle-expanded-2\">clipping. - Wriggle (Expanded)</a>: hip-hop, industrial hip-hop, horror</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://davequam.bandcamp.com/album/greasemania-vol-3\">Dave Quam - Greasemania Vol 3</a>: experimental, electronic</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dawnofashesofficial.bandcamp.com/album/blood-of-the-titans-remixes\">Dawn of Ashes - Blood of Titans (Remixes)</a>: industrial, aggrotech</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drumcorps.bandcamp.com/album/for-the-living\">Drumcorps - For the Living</a>: breakcore, experimental</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://faderhead.bandcamp.com/album/years-of-the-serpent\">Faderhead - Years of the Serpent</a>: industrial, ebm</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gelassenheit.bandcamp.com/album/gelassenheit\">Gelassenheit - Gelassenheit</a>: black metal, christian</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gelassenheit.bandcamp.com/album/don-thyself-in-the-armor-ov-god\">Gelassenheit - …Don Thyself in the Armor ov God</a>: black metal, christian</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hollywoodburns.bandcamp.com/album/the-age-of-the-saucers\">Hollywood Burns - The Age of Saucers</a>: soundtrack (to nothing), synth</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heliocentricband.bandcamp.com/album/ishmael\">Heliocentric - Ishmael</a>: metalcore, djent</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keygenchurch.bandcamp.com/album/--2\">Keygen Church - ░█░█░░█░█░█░</a>: electronic, black metal</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://noiseunit.bandcamp.com/album/deviator\">Noise Unit - Deviator</a>: ebm</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spiritboxofficial.bandcamp.com/album/eternal-blue\">Spiritbox - Eternal Blue</a>: metalcore, djent</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kscopemusic.bandcamp.com/album/portals\">TesseracT - Portals</a>: progressive metal, prog rock</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thou.bandcamp.com/album/hightower\">Thou - Hightower</a>: sludge, doom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://violence-project.bandcamp.com/album/opus-i\">Violence - Opus I</a>: industrial, metal, crossover</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://virtualterrorist.bandcamp.com/album/gutter-mixes-vol-2\">Virtual Terrorist - Gutter Mixes Vol 2</a>: industrial, noise</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"honorablementionsthatarenotonbandcampboo\">Honorable Mentions that are not on Bandcamp (boo!)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Between the Buried and Me - Colors II: progressive metal, jazz metal\n<ul>\n<li><em>Note: some of their music <a href=\"https://btbam.bandcamp.com/music\">is on bandcamp</a>, but not this album, yet.

It feels like a (modern) history lesson every time, too. Warning: every episode of this show seems to end on a melancholy note, literally and figuratively.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80227090\">I Am Mother</a> - I’d love to discuss this sci-fi suspense!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a> Season 1 - This felt like the most “comic book” of the MCU so far, due to the everybody having to fight everybody, etc. Great preaching from Sam at the end of the season.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(2018_film)\">Venom</a> - utterly ridiculous and a lot of fun</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/blade\">Blade</a> - rewatched this; interesting to hear Blade will be coming into the MCU</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Planet\">Fantastic Planet</a> - totally original french animated scifi from 1973</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/mr-show\">Mr. Show</a> Seasons 1–3 - some of this didn’t age well, but I love sketch comedy and their take on the Python-esque surreal sketch transitions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tenetfilm.com/?cinematic\">Tenet</a> - this was an instant purchase</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00yzlr0\">Line of Duty</a> Season 1 - What a wild ride! I had to space these out because they were so provocative, complex, and intense. Season 2 <em>not</em> recommended.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show\">A Black Lady Sketch Show</a> Season 2 - Not as good as season 1, but still good sketch comedy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608\">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> Season 2 - Not as mind-altering as Season 1, but still full of incredible experiments</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self/less\">Self/less</a> - Good, interesting. Would have been even better with more of a Christopher Nolan treatment and less of a Product Placement treatment.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU\">Welcome to the Internet</a> - “could I interest you in everything all of the time?“ Lots of good critique in this hilarious self-produced music video. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483\">Full special here.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Fear_(film)\">Primal Fear</a> - Very late to the party on this one. Surprised I didn’t see this back when it came out, as it was definitely my kind of movie. A little dated and a little predictable, but still very enjoyable and worth a discussion.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk\">Tiny Desk Concert: clipping.</a> - this is the first <em>actual</em> tiny desk concert, and the start of my obsession with clipping. (Stay tuned for Listening Recommendations)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thesuicidesquad.net\">The Suicide Squad</a> - Ludicrous, gory, and hilarious. I’m not much of a DC guy, but this was some wicked fun.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKtEJ9-GVoE\">Marc Rebillet and Madison McFerrin</a> - incredible looping and improv chemistry</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81122572\">Middleditch &amp; Schwartz</a> - long-form improv comedy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy\">Ted Lasso</a> Season 2 - not as good as season 1, but still challenging, human, and funny</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series)\">Foundation</a> Season 1 - Unnecessarily brutal at at times (<em>and I mean the storytelling, not the content…some details don’t need to be on the screen</em>), but otherwise very good</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://movies.disney.com/soul\">Soul</a> - Heartbreaking at times, but a beautiful movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html\">2021 Recommended Products &amp; Services</a> (incl. those related to watching)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/142837.html\">See last year’s writeup here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

The only notifications I allow on my phone are calendar appointments.<br /><br />4. I use privacy-respecting hardware and software, when they exist. When they don’t, I make do with the next best thing. (I’m looking at you, Apple!)<br /><br />5. I minimize opinion-checking. That is, I form my own conclusions rather than caring what “the internet thinks” about a topic.<br /><br />6. I don’t frequent places where assholes thrive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

As I’m now in my second month of <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/06/30/what-i-learned.html\">using a continuous glucose monitor</a>, and having conducted some self-experiments, I can see the effects of the above quote in my own body.<br /><br />For example: I participated in a coke challenge, where we had a coke after fasting compared to a coke after fasting <em>followed by walking for half an hour or more</em>. Walking improved my glucose response by 5 points on a 10-point scale (from a 2 to a 7). Here’s another way they say it in the podcast episode notes:</div>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img title=\"AMA #20_ Simplifying the complexities of insulin resistance_ how it's measured, how it manifests in the muscle and liver, and what we can do about it.png\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/f82ecd38ca.png\" alt=\"AMA  20 Simplifying the complexities of insulin resistance how it s measured how it manifests in the muscle and liver and what we can do about it\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"trix-content\">\n<div>I’m continuing to work with a trainer a couple times a week, doing a fun activity at least once a week, and am moving (walking, hiking, biking, etc.) almost every day. I <em>particularly </em>get moving after having a meal that would be a bit higher in carbs. It makes a significant difference on my results.<br /><br />To explain “to your tolerance”: we are all different in our hormonal setup (insulin, cortisol) as well as our muscle mass/distribution, both of which are major deciders of how much our body will burn glucose (and use glycogen) versus store it as fat (as triglycerides in adipose tissue).<br /><br />So their point there is that if we are getting good exercise, good muscle but not getting good metabolic results, then we also can limit simple carbs (especially fructose, which has particular effects beyond glucose) to get to where we want to be.<br /><br />This is really promising for preventing or reversing the issues listed, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other metabolic disorders.<br /><br />—<br /><br />Tagged: <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/LZW0VVmGykLNYG\">Resilient -&gt; Self</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "What I learned during my first week with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>About a week ago, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/06/22/got-started-with.html\">I got started with a continuous glucose monitor</a>. &quot;Glucose monitor&quot; means it's a device that records and reports blood sugar. &quot;Continuous&quot; means it is collecting data throughout the day and night.<br> <br>You might be wondering:<br><br></div><blockquote><em>Why? Are you diabetic or pre-diabetic? </em></blockquote><div><br>No, thankfully I am not!<br><br>However, data is growing showing a link between metabolic health and many major diseases, from the more well-known links like heart disease to the lesser-obvious ones like dementia and certain types of cancer. I want to reduce my risk for these chronic diseases and also increase my likelihood of being able to continue the types of activities that I enjoy. This is one part of broader habits meant to benefit my health (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/5VEculvEDoTT8x\">good sleep habits</a>, healthy eating, mental &amp; physical exercise, stress management, etc.).<br><br></div><blockquote><em>But can't you just eat keto or vegan or whatever my preferred diet is?</em></blockquote><div><em> </em></div><div>Turns out there can be great difference in people's genetics and biomes, leading to different responses to different foods. I have some simple eating habits that help me a great deal, but one reason I'm doing this is to see what is healthiest <em>for me</em>.<br><br></div><h1>About the CGM:</h1><div>I acquired my CGM through <a href=\"https://www.levelshealth.com/join?partner=RZUESFCY\">Levels</a>, as part of their beta. They do not manufacture the CGM device, but instead make an app and service that works with the CGM data.<br>The CGM is applied to the upper arm and stays there for up to 14 days. It's held on by an adhesive patch. While there, it records and holds up 8 hours worth of data. A mobile phone is held up to the CGM to pull in the data to the CGM manufacturer's default app.<br> Levels has developed an additional app and service that enhances the base data from the CGM manufacturer. It links with Apple Health data and the CGM app data to perform enhanced reporting.<br> The Levels app takes my notes about food/drink, exercise, or other events (like stressors) and uses these data points to score those actions by looking at the blood sugar for the 2 hours following the activity (they call this a &quot;zone&quot;). Zones are scored 1-10 based on blood sugar response. Days also get a rating of 1-100, and then daily, weekly, (and it looks like) monthly reports are provided. <br><br>The three main scoring factors Levels uses are:<br><br></div><ul><li>Glucose Variability (lower scores better)</li><li>Average Glucose (lower scores better)</li><li>Time in Target (higher is better, with &quot;target&quot; being 70-110 mg/dL)</li></ul><div><br>The app also builds a catalog of zone scores so that I start to get a profile of healthier activities (10/9/8) and less healthy ones, based on my unique metabolism. It also offers &quot;challenges&quot; of things to try different ways to see what my scores will be, to help me make informed decisions.</div><div><br></div><h1>What I've Learned:</h1><ul><li><strong><em>Mornings must start right</em></strong><strong>: </strong>I see that my days often start on my higher end for blood sugar. In addition, if I have carbs in the morning, it is easier to spike. Prevailing wisdom about this is that our bodies are ramping up cortisol in the morning as we prep for the day (and perhaps start experiencing stressors). One of my friends who is a doctor said this cortisol response is why many heart attacks happen in the early morning! What I've learned is I should skip breakfast, have a very-low (or no-carb) breakfast, or have a mild workout and then have a light-carb breakfast.</li><li><strong><em>Exercise makes even more difference than I thought: </em></strong>I already knew <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/wTiEurDggfjFE3\">that taking a walk after a meal</a> is helpful, but I didn't realize <em>just how much</em>. I had a pretty terrible dinner one night (pizza, sport drink, cake, ice cream), and some fun exercise before and afterwards, and my blood sugar wasn't too bad! Conversely (see bullet #1), I've had morning meals that registered as really bad (a #3 score), even when they didn't include sweets.</li><li><strong><em>Order of operations - not just for math:</em></strong> what order I have my meal in makes a difference. Putting the fiber, fat, and protein at the front of a meal leads to better results than having bread, etc. up front. If there's something a little bad in the meal, having it last really does help. This is likely because the absorption rate of carbs is slowed down by the fiber, fat, and protein.</li><li><strong><em>Ice cream isn't so bad: </em></strong>Likely a corollary of the above bullet, ice cream doesn't affect my blood sugar too much. This may be my best option when having an occasional treat.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>I'm looking to see what I learn about more food, exercise, and stressor events in the coming weeks. Which food pairings work for me and which do not? Does meditation counteract stressors sufficiently? Do I do ok with sweet potatoes? Bananas? Rice? Much more to learn!<br><br>---<br>Have you used a CGM? Do you have questions for me or ideas for experiments? I'd love to <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">hear from you</a>.</div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>Longer quote:<br><br></div><blockquote>During the years of the Iraq War and during the 2008 election, Christian blogs spent a lot of time writing about Constantinianism in voicing their opposition to the war in Iraq. Christian blogs were very Anabaptist during the golden era of blogging. Not so much anymore.<br><br>Why the change? <br><br>My argument, made in 2016, is that the post-evangelical Christians who inveighed again Constantinianism during the Bush years weren't really Anabaptists. They were, rather, Christian realists in the tradition of Reinhold Niebuhr. That is to say, progressive Christians, as witnessed in the 2008 election of Barack Obama, actually <em>wanted</em> and <em>desired</em> to win and weld the power of the nation state. You saw this hypocrisy in how post-evangelical bloggers hammered Bush with Constantine but said nary a word about Obama's drone war. Turns out, it's okay to pull the trigger when it's your guy holding the gun. And we saw again the thirst to win back and weld power among progressive Christians in the election of 2020. <br><br>All that to say, it's hard to decry Constantinianism when you're trying your damnedest to win every election. </blockquote><div><br>This is from the <a href=\"http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/06/will-real-christianity-please-stand-up.html\">second post</a> in a new Experimental Theology series called &quot;<a href=\"http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/05/will-real-christianity-please-stand-up.html\">Will the Real Christianity Please Stand Up</a>&quot;.<br><br>Now, as one of those folks who started blogging in the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/28/yr-mennonite.html\"><em>became</em></a> Anabaptist during that &quot;golden era&quot;, and then <em>maintained</em> that anabaptist perspective, this whole post (ugly parts and all) rings true to me. <br><br>Richard Beck's key blog series have become some of my favorite books: <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781608992423\"><em>Unclean</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781620327777\"><em>The Slavery of Death</em></a><em>, </em>and many more. I'm very interested to see where this series will go, and how Beck will deal with the &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman\">No True Scotsman</a>&quot; problem in the analysis.<br><br>---<br>Thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Let me know!</a></div>\n</div>\n",

I grew up in a wealthy country, didn't experience serious health conditions, and have not had to worry about if I would be able to find my next meal. I had access to good education. I haven't been harassed, harmed, or neglected due to the color of my skin. And most importantly <em>for this topic</em>, I grew up in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom\">Christendom</a>, a part of the world where Christian belief has been a dominant force in public opinion and even in governance.<br><br> It's in these areas of Christendom where I am surprised (and frankly, embarrassed) when Christians talk about being \"persecuted\". Christians in Christendom often read Bible stories and see themselves in the narratives as the Israelites enslaved in Egypt, or the early Christians under Rome. But what we must realize is we are more likely to be on the side of Pharaoh, Herod, or Caesar.<br><br>When you dig into it what \"persecution\" these Christendom-Christians are facing, it usually ends up being one of two things:<br><br></div><ul><li>Social consequences for conservative ideology and/or for bigotry</li><li>An underlying fear that we are moving into a post-Christendom world</li></ul><div><br>Neither of these are persecution. Let's talk about them in order.<br><br></div><h1>Social Consequences</h1><div>To understand this one, we need to step back a bit.<br><br>One of the problems with Christendom is that Christianity syncretizes with the government, with the dominant political beliefs, the dominant economic order, and/or with nationalism. Christians begin to conflate being part of a party, ideology, or nation with being a Christian. We can end up working as hard (or harder) for those beliefs than we do trying to follow the Lamb.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" title=\"Download The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_378387804\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png\" alt=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 2x, https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br>Specifically, far too many Christians in Christendom have an unhealthy (and frankly, heretical) confusion of social conservatism and Christianity. They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

As I read these, I realized they&rsquo;d make a better framing for how I&rsquo;ve been approaching some challenges my team faces at work. I&rsquo;ve been communicating with my manager using the perspective of &quot;accountability without authority or responsibility&quot;, and while that&rsquo;s true, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Unicorn Project<!-- raw HTML omitted --> ideals might be an even better lens by which to view the problems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Let me work through them to see what we are doing or could do in each area.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Locality and Simplicity<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is the core issue, as I&rsquo;ve recently been thinking about it. My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don&rsquo;t necessarily add value.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle.

This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We&rsquo;ve got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I&rsquo;ve been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We&rsquo;ve got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions.

				"content_text": "Have you heard of <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781942788768\">The Unicorn Project</a>? It's the follow-up to the great <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781942788294\">Phoenix Project</a>. As I said in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/01/02/nonfiction-review.html\">2021 book review</a>:<br><br></div><blockquote>&quot;what Kim did for Ops &amp; DevOps in the Phoenix project, he has continued for product development in this work&quot;</blockquote><div><br>Both of these books use narrative to demonstrate the move to agile ways of working and devops transformations within an auto-parts selling business.<br><br>These five ideals are very helpful for looking at ways to enhance a technology practice.<br><br>---<br><br>Here's where I'm going to &quot;think out loud&quot; again. As I read these, I realized they'd make a better framing for how I've been approaching some challenges my team faces at work. I've been communicating with my manager using the perspective of &quot;accountability without authority or responsibility&quot;, and while that's true, the <em>Unicorn Project</em> ideals might be an even better lens by which to view the problems.<br><br>Let me work through them to see what we are doing or could do in each area.<br><br></div><h1>Locality and Simplicity</h1><div>This is the core issue, as I've recently been thinking about it. My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don't necessarily add value.<br><br>To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<br><br></div><ul><li>here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result</li><li>there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own</li><li>there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work</li></ul><div><br></div><div>For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle. I've been advocating for this two-step approach, but now have a different way to talk about it.<br><br></div><h1>Focus, Flow, and Joy</h1><div>We have a culture of meetings. This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<br><br>Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<br><br>We've got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<br><br></div><ul><li>&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus</li><li>&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I've been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We've got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I'm helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn't a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn't have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it's very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it's ok to speak up, that their concerns won't be dismissed and they won't be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it's ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won't be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn't be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn't used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div>\n",

Maybe I'm brainstorming, doing a little journaling, or writing a follow-up while presenting (a common occurrence).\n\nThe good news is that Baron Fig's [Strategist](https://www.baronfig.com/accessories/strategist-index-cards?style=dot+grid) cards fit in the holder perfectly, too. You get the nice standing view, as well as the card storage in the block. I expect this would work well with any rounded-corner 3x5 index cards, too. (If you have others that you try, [let me know](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact)!)\n\n(pictured on top of my super favorite veg-tan Hobonichi cover, with a [TWSBI Go Smoke](https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-go-smoke-fountain-pen) and Sailor ink.)\n",

I couldn't identify them at this stage, but they were labeled and had stakes to help them grow. I fixed one that had lost its support. I don't know how safe those will be for human consumption due to the runoff from parking lots (if you have thoughts, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">please share</a>!) but they should be a nice addition at least for the animal life.<br><br>I couldn't navigate everywhere I wanted, due to the depth and speed of the water, but I had a lot of fun.

There's also a table of data showing the delta between normal price and SSO-included price. <a href=\"https://sso.tax\">Take a look!</a><br><br>Now, I'm not saying all services require SSO.

				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>A little while back, I was having a conversation with my company’s CTO. We were discussing what engineering behaviors we wanted to encourage to continue to promote trust and safety.<br><br></div><blockquote><em>How do we build in helpful behaviors? How do we make doing the right thing easy? How do we make things repeatable, scalable, and resilient? How do we spend our time on the most valuable things?</em></blockquote><div><br>There are, of course, multiple interesting answers to these questions and many things our teams are doing to excel in these areas. But one of the things that came out of this discussion was that our CTO was having engineering leaders go back and read the (now classic) book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/lean-software-development-an-agile-toolkit/9780321150783\"><em>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</em></a> by Mary and Tom Poppendiek.<br><br>So, I decided to do the same, and I also planned to share the lessons with my direct team (of Business Information Security Officers) and the broader team of Risk &amp; Security. One of the BISOs on my team (who has also read the book) has also volunteered to work with me on materials. We’ve got a great partner, too, who will help us turn the lessons and principles into handy resources that the broader team can use.<br><br>So what is this writing for, then?

Like other parts of consumer culture, we look for the latest \"advances\", the best bang-for-our-buck, the quickest thing, the most popular thing, the best advertised thing, or the super-utilitarian-just-get-the-nutrients-in-me thing.<br><br>Whichever of these we drift towards, our relationship with food moves away from thinking of food as something to enjoy in-and-of-itself, shifts away from cultural food traditions (with all their accumulated wisdom), and shifts away from (non-performative) eating with our community.<br><br>This reminder, then, is a simple call back to paying attention to what is being eaten. <br><br></div><blockquote>Take a small bite.<br>How does it smell?<br>How does it feel?<br>How does it taste?<br>Does it change as I chew or as it lingers in my mouth?</blockquote><div><br>Following this paradigm, a few things happen:<br><br></div><ol><li>I enjoy my food much more</li><li>I'm amazed how the tiniest of bites can give as much (or more) satisfaction as a large one</li><li>I realize that after more than a few bites of anything, I'm not enjoying anymore, but merely <em>consuming</em></li><li>I realize my fullness much more quickly</li><li>I can eat my foods in any order I want, because I won't overdue it with anything on my plate, but know I will move on once I am no longer enjoying that item</li></ol><div><br>Now, there is one big exception to this \"intuitive\" approach to eating. Some of these programs handle it, others may not. <br><br></div><pre>SUGAR is basically a drug.</pre><div><br>Sugar makes us more hungry. Seriously. Because of the way fructose and glucose work in the body, having sugar (and even simple carbs, which are effectively glucose) causes our bodies to store fat and ramp up our appetite. So, \"intuition\" gets short-circuited by our biological processes.<br><br>Pollan has lots of advice to help avoid this trap. <em>Naturally Slim</em> advocates cutting sugar. I'm not sure if <em>Intuitive Eating</em> handles it. (<a href=\"mailto:toddg@hey.com\">email me if you know?</a>)<br><br>Because I used a Pollan quote related to dessert, let me pair it with these other practices from <i>Food Rules</i>, in order to present the more-complete picture. Bold is Pollan's wording, italics are my comments.</div><div><br></div><ul><li><strong>4 Avoid food products that contain high-fructose corn syrup.</strong></li><li><strong>5 Avoid foods that have some form of sugar (or sweetener) listed among the top three ingredients.</strong></li><li><strong>35 Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature. </strong>(<em>e.g. whole fruit with fiber</em>)</li><li><strong>37 “The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead.”</strong></li><li><strong>39 Eat all the junk food you want as long as you cook it yourself. </strong>(<em>e.g. if you want pie, chips, or ice cream you gotta make it from the raw ingredients!</em>)</li></ul><div><br>In the week ahead, this is a good reminder for me to be mindful. To <em>eat</em> rather than <em>consume</em>.

I won't share all the details, but will share a few notes along the way.<br><br><em>The Background:<br></em>All the leaders in my broader group (think: my boss's boss's group, about 800 people) are going through a leadership curriculum. As part of this, we had a leadership competency survey that went to our manager, a small number of self-selected peers, and a small number of self-selected stakeholders. There were 27 questions rated 1-5, with 3 questions for each of the 9 competencies that were being measured.<br><br><em>Initial Observations:</em></div><ol><li><strong>Benchmark:</strong> One of the first things I looked at was whether I exceeded the benchmark score. This was not simple vanity: it's at the top of the report. The summary shows how I scored myself overall, how each of the respondent groups rated me overall, and how the broader respondents rated everybody (the benchmark). I'm happy to see that I exceeded the benchmark, but without a view of the distribution I can't tell for sure how significant the difference is. I realize I <em>should not spend too much time here</em>, as it's comparative with others and not necessarily fruitful.</li><li><strong>Perception Gaps: </strong>Next, the survey advises to be wary of gaps between the self-rating and those of respondents, or between types of respondents. They suggest that 1 point (in either direction) is cause for concern. I've made progress here! In other community assessments (e.g. EQ360) in years past, I significantly underrated myself. I'm pleased that I still erred towards under-estimation, and that the margin of under-estimation has dropped to 0.28 points (on that 5-point rating scale). My goal is to continue to get that closer to 0, but as long as there is an error, I'd rather it be on the side of under-estimation. I had no major gap between respondent group types, which indicates I'm not overly-prioritizing some audiences over others. Later in the report we'll look at gaps on specific rating areas.</li><li><strong>Competencies:</strong> Across the 9 competencies, mine were all clustered around the same rating (only 0.27 difference between my best and worst), with scores I'm happy with. The only surprising result here was \"Dare to Be Curious\" being my worst. Why? Because <em>curiosity</em> is one of my primary approaches, especially in challenging moments or situations. Looking at the three questions that contributed to that competency rating, my lowest result (4.6) was for <em>\"Asks the 'right' questions to size up or evaluate situations\"</em>. I know that sometimes I go too quickly to brainstorming and solving instead of asking coaching-style questions. I'll continue to work on this practice. Here is the ranking of my competencies, in order:<ol><li>Model the Way</li><li>Value Every Voice</li><li>Respect Differences</li><li>Connect with Purpose</li><li>Improve and Grow</li><li>Partner for Success</li><li>Embrace Transparency</li><li>Make it Happen Today</li><li>Dare to Be Curious</li></ol></li></ol><div><br><em>Breakdown:<br></em>I like the way they've looked at the four quadrants based on self-rating and respondent rating.

(The price point is great, too!)</p>\n<p>I have three different workspaces:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>My second brain/public notes/digital garden (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/digital-garden/\">link</a>)</li>\n<li>Personal notes &amp; tasks (<em>what we’re here to talk about today!</em>)</li>\n<li>A shared space for home &amp; family<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, how am I handling my personal notes &amp; tasks? Let’s dive in.</p>\n<h3 id=\"considerations\">Considerations</h3>\n<p>I want notes to be easy-to-enter. I want them to accommodate both daily planning, ongoing note-taking, and tie-ins to project, people, or topic pages.</p>\n<p>I like the idea of Leuchtturm’s <a href=\"https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/some-lines-a-day-the-5-year-memory-book.html\">5-year journals</a>, which give the ability to look back on what I was doing this day in previous years. But, for me, it’s hard for me to to keep a good habit of writing in them.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-setup\">The Setup</h3>\n<p>I created a top level page (a “Document”, in Craft parlance) called “Dailies”. I made it one of my <em>Starred Documents</em> for easy access.</p>\n<p>“Dailies” has sub-pages for each month. Each of <em>those</em> subpages has day subpages. Here&rsquo;s what that looks like.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Let me explain a few things you’re seeing here.</p>\n<p>First, sub-pages show a bit of their internal content, by default<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup>. I didn’t start until the 10th of January, so that’s why you’ll see January’s first internal entry being “10”.</p>\n<p>Second, you’ll see March is empty but April is not. This is because I created the April 1st entry ahead of time, because I have something planned (for April Fools). This is an <em>intended feature</em> of my system: the ability to put a note or task on a future date, so that I see it when I get there.</p>\n<p>Third, you’ll see the bottom of this page (and all pages) have a “Links To This Page” section. These are backlinks, an important feature. Craft supports linking to pages, subpages, and lines/blocks to show the backlinks on the page that is being referenced elsewhere.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-month\">The Month</h2>\n<p>Ok, so what does it look like when we dive into a month? Here’s that April view.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I went ahead and created the 2nd through 10th subpages, so you can see how the month view shows up. There’s nothing particularly exciting about the monthly subpage. It’s just a container.</p>\n<p>But, as you can see with April 1st, I’m setup so that there’s a little preview of the top content for each day.</p>\n<p>Let’s move on to…</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-day\">The Day</h3>\n<p>Ok, this is the heart of it, then. Here’s how I might take notes for a day:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Again, a few points to note:</p>\n<p>You can see in the upper left the hierarchy of notes I’m “in”. This is in my Dailies page, February subpage, and 19th page.</p>\n<p>To get that year-over-year view, I’m using a toggle list feature to create a section for the year (and then for future years). This allows me to open the toggle and review previous years when I first open the note in future years, but then close the toggle to focus on the current date/year.</p>\n<p>My notes are a combination of things I want to accomplish, things I’m considering, and micro-journaling of what I do throughout the day.</p>\n<p><em>All</em> of these lines can be subpages themselves (meaning I can go into it and take more notes), or can contain links to other pages, subpages, or blocks within my workspace. I often link to pages I&rsquo;ve created for projects, people, or topics. (<em>and then on that page I can see backlinks to this reference!</em>)</p>\n<p>The tasks can be checked off and completed.</p>\n<p>Finally, just as I’ve linked out to other places, I have backlinks inbound to this date from other places. I can follow those links to see the connections.</p>\n<p><em>Not pictured</em>: I can add in-app sketches, scanned notes, documents, or images to my daily page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"other-factors\">Other Factors</h3>\n<p>I also keep a document that is my intake document, so all items that come in from OSX or iOS sharesheet go there first.</p>\n<p>I have templates, including day start, week start, and week end. These include processing that intake inbox, making sure new notes have the correct home, and completing my planning and review activities.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m finding this process works very well for me. It’s easy to stick with. It let’s me keep everything in one place. It lets me find and search for what I need, easily. It’s not ugly. It’s fun to work with.</p>\n<p>Would something like this work for you?

But none of them have worked for me like [Craft.do](https://www.craft.do/) has.\n\nI can’t put my finger exactly on why it’s the winner, but it’s some combination of features, speed, visual appeal/distinctiveness, and customer-responsiveness. (The price point is great, too!)\n\nI have three different workspaces:\n\n1. My second brain/public notes/digital garden ([link](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/digital-garden/))\n2. Personal notes & tasks (*what we’re here to talk about today!*)\n3. A shared space for home & family[^1]\n\nSo, how am I handling my personal notes & tasks? Let’s dive in.\n\n### Considerations\n\nI want notes to be easy-to-enter. I want them to accommodate both daily planning, ongoing note-taking, and tie-ins to project, people, or topic pages.\n\nI like the idea of Leuchtturm’s [5-year journals](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/some-lines-a-day-the-5-year-memory-book.html), which give the ability to look back on what I was doing this day in previous years. But, for me, it’s hard for me to to keep a good habit of writing in them.\n\n### The Setup\n\nI created a top level page (a “Document”, in Craft parlance) called “Dailies”. I made it one of my _Starred Documents_ for easy access.\n\n“Dailies” has sub-pages for each month. Each of *those* subpages has day subpages. Here's what that looks like.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/7bd02cab33.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" />\n\nLet me explain a few things you’re seeing here.\n\nFirst, sub-pages show a bit of their internal content, by default[^2]. I didn’t start until the 10th of January, so that’s why you’ll see January’s first internal entry being “10”.\n\nSecond, you’ll see March is empty but April is not. This is because I created the April 1st entry ahead of time, because I have something planned (for April Fools). This is an _intended feature_ of my system: the ability to put a note or task on a future date, so that I see it when I get there.\n\nThird, you’ll see the bottom of this page (and all pages) have a “Links To This Page” section. These are backlinks, an important feature. Craft supports linking to pages, subpages, and lines/blocks to show the backlinks on the page that is being referenced elsewhere.[^3]\n\n## The Month\n\nOk, so what does it look like when we dive into a month? Here’s that April view.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/aea28d5e1a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"472\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI went ahead and created the 2nd through 10th subpages, so you can see how the month view shows up. There’s nothing particularly exciting about the monthly subpage. It’s just a container. \n\nBut, as you can see with April 1st, I’m setup so that there’s a little preview of the top content for each day.\n\nLet’s move on to…\n\n### The Day\n\nOk, this is the heart of it, then. Here’s how I might take notes for a day:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/391732da82.jpg\" width=\"556\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAgain, a few points to note:\n\nYou can see in the upper left the hierarchy of notes I’m “in”. This is in my Dailies page, February subpage, and 19th page. \n\nTo get that year-over-year view, I’m using a toggle list feature to create a section for the year (and then for future years). This allows me to open the toggle and review previous years when I first open the note in future years, but then close the toggle to focus on the current date/year.\n\nMy notes are a combination of things I want to accomplish, things I’m considering, and micro-journaling of what I do throughout the day. \n\n*All* of these lines can be subpages themselves (meaning I can go into it and take more notes), or can contain links to other pages, subpages, or blocks within my workspace. I often link to pages I've created for projects, people, or topics. (_and then on that page I can see backlinks to this reference!_)\n\nThe tasks can be checked off and completed.\n\nFinally, just as I’ve linked out to other places, I have backlinks inbound to this date from other places. I can follow those links to see the connections.\n\n_Not pictured_: I can add in-app sketches, scanned notes, documents, or images to my daily page.\n\n### Other Factors\n\nI also keep a document that is my intake document, so all items that come in from OSX or iOS sharesheet go there first.\n\nI have templates, including day start, week start, and week end. These include processing that intake inbox, making sure new notes have the correct home, and completing my planning and review activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI’m finding this process works very well for me. It’s easy to stick with. It let’s me keep everything in one place. It lets me find and search for what I need, easily. It’s not ugly. It’s fun to work with.\n\nWould something like this work for you? What questions do you have?\n\n[^1]: Note: the 2nd and 3rd spaces will move to  [\"Craft Connect\" and \"offline spaces\"](https://www.craft.do/whats-new/b/87714FD1-ECBA-4B40-B084-767136D51B6D/V1.2.2_-_Craft_Connect,_Improved) for additional privacy and control, when those become available in the near future.\n\n[^2]: Though as with much in Craft, you can edit how things are visualized, more-so even than in some word-processing documents, and including in some ways that are unique to Craft.\n\n[^3]: You can’t see *unlinked* references to a page, yet, but this is a feature they are considering.\n",

(You can also unlock more of your strengths <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/strengthsfinder.aspx\">on their site</a>.)</p>\n<p>The research behind the strengths shows that we can make a much bigger difference by leaning into our strengths than by focusing on our weaknesses. While we might need a certain level of baseline proficiency for some roles &amp; responsibilities, after meeting those requirements, our time is most impactful if spent on the ways where we do our best.</p>\n<p>My top ten strengths are the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Activator (I)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Intellection (S)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Analytical (S)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Ideation (S)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Command (I)</strong></li>\n<li>Connectedness (R)</li>\n<li>Input (S)</li>\n<li>Strategic (S)</li>\n<li>Learner (S)</li>\n<li>Self-Assurance (I)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You may be wondering about the letter after each (or the corresponding color above). Let me explain that first. The 34 strengths are grouped into 4 categories of themes, based on how they relate to leadership.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“I” stands for “influencing”. My #1 strength and 2 more of my top strengths are related to influencing.</li>\n<li>“S” stands for “strategic thinking”.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/404256fd1c.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"518\" alt=\"\" />\n\nDo you know your top strengths? When it comes to personal assessments, the Strengthsfinder (or Clifton Strengths) is my favorite. Based on research from Gallup, Strengthsfinder looks at 34 different themes, and helps you understand what your best approaches are.\n\nYou can get the [Strengthsfinder 2.0 book here](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781595620156). It includes a code to take the short assessment and receive your top 5 strengths. (You can also unlock more of your strengths [on their site](https://www.gallup.com/cliftonstrengths/en/strengthsfinder.aspx).)\n\nThe research behind the strengths shows that we can make a much bigger difference by leaning into our strengths than by focusing on our weaknesses. While we might need a certain level of baseline proficiency for some roles & responsibilities, after meeting those requirements, our time is most impactful if spent on the ways where we do our best.\n\nMy top ten strengths are the following:\n\n\n1. **Activator (I)**\n2. **Intellection (S)**\n3. **Analytical (S)**\n4. **Ideation (S)**\n5. **Command (I)**\n6. Connectedness (R)\n7. Input (S)\n8. Strategic (S)\n9. Learner (S)\n10. Self-Assurance (I)\n\nYou may be wondering about the letter after each (or the corresponding color above). Let me explain that first. The 34 strengths are grouped into 4 categories of themes, based on how they relate to leadership.\n\n\n* “I” stands for “influencing”. My #1 strength and 2 more of my top strengths are related to influencing. \n* “S” stands for “strategic thinking”. A whopping 6 of my top strengths are related to strategic thinking.\n* “R” stands for “relationship building”. **Connectedness** is my top strength related to relationship building and **Individualization** (not pictured) is my second highest.\n* “E” stands for “executing”. **Belief** and **Responsibility** (not pictured) are my top strengths related to execution.\n\nWith all that explained, what is the overall summary of my top strengths, and what do they say about the way I best approach life?\n\n### *Strategic Thinking* is a major theme\n\nThere are 8 themes related to _Strategic Thinking_, and they dominate my top strengths. \n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/76c29c82f5.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nIf you know me at all, you've probably noticed that I'm continually learning, collecting insights, sifting through information to find the signals in the noise, clarifying situations, engaging in deep conversations, imagining possible futures, brainstorming, asking tough questions, analyzing paths of possible success & failure, and spending time in intentional reflection. \n\nMy _Strategic Thinking_ strengths mean that I can be a major help when it comes to creating a vision, breaking new ground, developing new ideas, setting direction, focusing our attention on what matters, changing systems, and accounting for changing factors.\n\nBut there’s always a downside, right? With so many strengths related to _Strategic Thinking_, there is a chance that nothing comes of all that thinking. Analysis paralysis. Theory without practice. Cheap talk. \n\nAll this strategic thinking needs to actually be _useful_.\n\n### So what are we going to do about it?\n\nWe need an antidote for thought-without-action. Luckily, **Activator**, my #1 strength, is just what the doctor ordered! The **Activator** theme is precisely about turning thoughts into action.\n\nLeading from this strength means I’m always looking at what’s next, bringing energy and excitement to it. Having a vision of a future is great, but it starts to become reality when I'm spurring myself and others to actually get moving in that direction. I don’t leave important conversation without concrete next steps, even if those steps are small ones. Building on that excitement and momentum is key to getting change happening.\n\n**Activator**, combined with my *Strategic Thinking* strengths, means I'm eager to actually test out theories and get rapid feedback. We can get real data to know if the approach needs to change, move full speed ahead, or be shelved to make room for something better. Innovative ideas plus rapid feedback cycles are how we evolve.\n\nMy so-far-unmentioned top talents also relate to **Activator**, too. With **Connectedness**, I am often bringing people together and sharing the broader picture, both of which helps people rally around the cause. **Command** and **Self-Assurance** mean people often look to me to make tough decisions in risky situations, reassure or inspire them, and help remove roadblocks & barriers.

				"content_html": "<p><em>To view other 2020 review posts, visit the <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html\">main post here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>I love music. And though I listen to less than I used to (due to more meetings and more podcasts &amp; audiobooks) I still really enjoy listening to music when I can. I explore new sounds and visit old favorites. I play music for different moods &amp; contexts. I curate playlists with a unique style of sound. I still think of my music sometimes like I would when I was a DJ.</p>\n<p>After Google killed yet again another one of their best products (Google Music) and replaced it with something worse (YouTube Music) I again started working on going back to the tried-and-true-but-takes-more-work method of owning and managing my own music.</p>\n<p>I prefer to source my music from <a href=\"https://bandcamp.com\">Bandcamp</a>. I like Bandcamp because they seem to treat the artists better than other sites, and they allow you to manage and re-download or stream the music you have bought through Bandcamp. They also have many features for music discovery. On many Fridays throughout 2020, they removed their cut entirely and let the full purchase price go to the artist/label. I think they do this every once in a while even in non-awful years, too.</p>\n<p>I also re-signed up for iTunes Match. Apple has somewhat hidden this service, because they want you to use their streaming service. However, it&rsquo;s still there (look under &ldquo;Features&rdquo; at the very bottom of the main iTunes store page) and is a nice option to make your library available on all your devices. It takes all your apple music, plus anything you have in your chosen music folder (e.g. from CD rips or Bandcamp purchases) and either matches it to the iTunes version of the song, or uploads a copy for your devices to use, if they don&rsquo;t think they have it. It costs much less than streaming services, too.</p>\n<p>With this move, I also started &ldquo;scrobbling&rdquo; again. This is a method where you ping a scrobbling service with each song you play, and it keeps track of your listening stats. I use <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/\">last.fm</a>, though there are other compatible services available. I didn&rsquo;t start scrobbling again until I was adjusting my setup during the year, so my numbers don&rsquo;t represent the full year. That said, I can at least see what I&rsquo;ve been listening to later in the year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"overall\">Overall</h3>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>I scrobbled 5653 plays, and my top genres according to <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams/listening-report/year\">my last.fm report</a> were:</p>\n<pre><code>- Industrial\n- Electronic\n- Metalcore\n- Industrial Metal\n- Rock\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"artists\">Artists</h3>\n<p>I listened 1230 different artists! The top 10 were:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>Some of these top 10 could arguably even be smashed together. Argyle Park, Circle of Dust, and Celldweller are all bands from Klayton (aka Klay Scott aka Scott Albert). In addition, Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly is a prominent contributor (as producer, electronic musician, or remixer) to many of the Fear Factory albums &amp; songs that I listened to.</p>\n<p>Most of the bands listed this year I&rsquo;ve listened to for years, but Seeming is new. I found Seeming on Bandcamp this year and and have been enjoying some of their catalog, especially their newest. On that front&hellip;</p>\n<h3 id=\"albums\">Albums</h3>\n<p>I listened to 1819 different albums! The top ten were:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>The 4th one there is kind of a cheat, as it&rsquo;s really 3 Haste the Day albums re-issued in 1. Based on the counts, you can see there was really nothing that I listened to on repeat all year, but several of these albums had multiple playthroughs, as well as scrobbles from listening to my &ldquo;loved tracks&rdquo; automatic playlist.</p>\n<p>I reviewed <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/01/of-the-month.html\">NOENEMIES</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/02/03/of-the-month.html\">Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes</a> earlier this year, and shared some thoughts and favorite tracks.</p>\n<p>Igorrr is the undisputed king of wild genre mashups, and <em>Spirituality and Distortion</em> once again shows continued evolution in their art.

				"content_text": "_To view other 2020 review posts, visit the [main post here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html)._\n\n---\n\nI love music. And though I listen to less than I used to (due to more meetings and more podcasts & audiobooks) I still really enjoy listening to music when I can. I explore new sounds and visit old favorites. I play music for different moods & contexts. I curate playlists with a unique style of sound. I still think of my music sometimes like I would when I was a DJ.\n\nAfter Google killed yet again another one of their best products (Google Music) and replaced it with something worse (YouTube Music) I again started working on going back to the tried-and-true-but-takes-more-work method of owning and managing my own music. \n\nI prefer to source my music from [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com). I like Bandcamp because they seem to treat the artists better than other sites, and they allow you to manage and re-download or stream the music you have bought through Bandcamp. They also have many features for music discovery. On many Fridays throughout 2020, they removed their cut entirely and let the full purchase price go to the artist/label. I think they do this every once in a while even in non-awful years, too.\n\nI also re-signed up for iTunes Match. Apple has somewhat hidden this service, because they want you to use their streaming service. However, it's still there (look under \"Features\" at the very bottom of the main iTunes store page) and is a nice option to make your library available on all your devices. It takes all your apple music, plus anything you have in your chosen music folder (e.g. from CD rips or Bandcamp purchases) and either matches it to the iTunes version of the song, or uploads a copy for your devices to use, if they don't think they have it. It costs much less than streaming services, too.\n\nWith this move, I also started \"scrobbling\" again. This is a method where you ping a scrobbling service with each song you play, and it keeps track of your listening stats. I use [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/), though there are other compatible services available. I didn't start scrobbling again until I was adjusting my setup during the year, so my numbers don't represent the full year. That said, I can at least see what I've been listening to later in the year.\n\n### Overall\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/e5f65a4063.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"300\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI scrobbled 5653 plays, and my top genres according to [my last.fm report](https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams/listening-report/year) were:\n\n    - Industrial\n    - Electronic\n    - Metalcore\n    - Industrial Metal\n    - Rock\n\n### Artists\n\nI listened 1230 different artists! The top 10 were:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/441acef861.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"388\" alt=\"\" />\n\nSome of these top 10 could arguably even be smashed together. Argyle Park, Circle of Dust, and Celldweller are all bands from Klayton (aka Klay Scott aka Scott Albert). In addition, Rhys Fulber of Front Line Assembly is a prominent contributor (as producer, electronic musician, or remixer) to many of the Fear Factory albums & songs that I listened to.\n\nMost of the bands listed this year I've listened to for years, but Seeming is new. I found Seeming on Bandcamp this year and and have been enjoying some of their catalog, especially their newest. On that front...\n\n### Albums\n\nI listened to 1819 different albums! The top ten were:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/9920fc1f1e.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"469\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe 4th one there is kind of a cheat, as it's really 3 Haste the Day albums re-issued in 1. Based on the counts, you can see there was really nothing that I listened to on repeat all year, but several of these albums had multiple playthroughs, as well as scrobbles from listening to my \"loved tracks\" automatic playlist.\n\nI reviewed [NOENEMIES](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/01/of-the-month.html) and [Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/02/03/of-the-month.html) earlier this year, and shared some thoughts and favorite tracks.\n\nIgorrr is the undisputed king of wild genre mashups, and _Spirituality and Distortion_ once again shows continued evolution in their art. In any given track you may find a combination of baroque music, metal, opera, electronic music, eastern musical styles, western music styles, hand-made instruments, and various other influences. [Watch & listen](https://youtu.be/YCqG9B8j-cI) to \"Downgrade Dessert\" for one of the more \"normal\" but amazing tracks on the album.\n\n### Tracks\n\nI listened to 3917 different tracks! The top ten were:\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2021/c3f99a2af7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"458\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe top 3 tracks I definitely listened to on loop at some point in the year. Both  \"Computorr\" and \"Go Small\" could be theme songs for 2020.\n\n\"Computorrr\" ([listen](https://drumcorps.bandcamp.com/album/computorr)) is a gltchy, sample-filled, frenetic track that should have you dancing around and thinking about how technology works in our lives.\n\n> \"TV got your brain\"\n\n> \"I want to get online\"\n\n> \"I **need** a computer\"\n\n> \"We work with anybody else who's fighting the system\"\n\n\"Go Small\" ([watch & listen](https://youtu.be/9Mo3euMRaro)) is a simple, haunting, independent, somewhat-melodramatic track that evokes many feelings of the year.\n\n> \"when the world is drowned in flames\nwrite something you can understand\"\n\n> \"the earth is radiantly suicidal\nif there's any play in favor of survival, it's: _go small_\"\n\n--- \n\nWhat did you listen to this year? Any recommendations?.\n",

Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how different efforts turned out (or didn&rsquo;t):</p>\n<h3 id=\"resilient\">Resilient</h3>\n<p>Resilient (<a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/\">here</a>) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open &amp; Secure) to share helpful &amp; meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: &ldquo;security, society, sustainability, and self.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively&hellip;it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; and conversational.

				"content_text": "_To view other 2020 review posts, visit the [main post here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html)._\n\n---\n\nOutside of work, I had several projects this year. Frankly, I didn't have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.\n\nHere's how different efforts turned out (or didn't):\n\n### Resilient\n\nResilient ([here](https://resilient.substack.com/)) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open & Secure) to share helpful & meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: \"security, society, sustainability, and self.\" \n\nI originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively...it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a \"work in progress\" and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word...but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.\n\nSo, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a [Resilient book collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient). I wrote about [watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies](https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography).  I made my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) graph (notes) from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [CSO50](https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/) conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.\n\nI host [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/publish) on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I'm concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people's time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.\n\nI'm not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider.

So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!\n\n### Northern Fires\n\nI started the [Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html) in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, [Silent Planet](https://www.silentplanetband.com/), has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song. \n\nThe idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica).

Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works. \n\n### 40 for 40\n\nI turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I'd started collecting will probably make it into the next project...\n\n### DearKiddos\n\n[DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/) was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church. \n\nThis one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don't get burnt out on the project.\n\n### Inktober\n\nI had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made [a few entries and catch-up entries](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/) which were frankly pretty bad...but I knew that going in. Though I wasn't consistent and didn't finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I'm not sure if I'll do it in 2021, or not.\n\n### Home Office\n\nMy spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office.

I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.\n\n### Wet & Wild\n\n(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn't sure what to call this.)\n\nI've been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access).

I send both to [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/).\n\nIf you're not familiar with feeds & feed readers, the basic idea is that instead of having to go and check a bunch of sites periodically for updates, you can list the ones that you like, and _have those items come to you_. Feed readers often add other functionality, too. For Inoreader, I like the ability to take in normal (RSS) feeds as well as newsletters and Twitter accounts. It also has filtering rules, so I can use criteria to hide or highlight certain items.\n\nThe net result is I don't have to wait for those things to hit my inbox nor do I feel the urge to obsessively check sites & social media. I can just periodically open up Inoreader and check them _on my schedule_ instead of having the schedule dictated to me.\n\nI check my feeds about once a day, see which items are worth my attention, and either read them directly if short, or export them to [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/) if they are longer or worthy of highlights.

				"content_text": "<p><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781513805931\">I Am Not Your Enemy: Stories to Transform a Divided World</a></em> by <a href=\"https://michaelmcray.com\">Michael T. McRay</a></p><p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, Highly Recommended</p><blockquote><p>The stories we tell and the ones we listen to change us all the time, in large and little ways, and <em>we'd do well to consider carefully which stories win our attention</em>.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><em>Note: you can find this title and more on the <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient\">Resilient</a> booklist. Commsissions from sales from that list help acquire more books for review.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Summary</h2><p>From Palestine, Israel, South Africa, Northern Ireland, and the USA, we hear the stories of people working for peace. </p><blockquote><p>Through this book, we learn of the possibility of peace and of the practical requirements of forgiveness and reconciliation. Can you reconcile while injustice continues? Can you forgive those who burned down your home while still living in its ruins?</p></blockquote><p><em>— from the Foreword by Ishmael Beah</em></p><p>McRay takes care with the stories of the people he interviews, presenting their varying experiences with authenticity and grace. Peace is not an easy process, and we see time and again that the work is long and hard.</p><blockquote><p>…it can take as long to get out we of a conflict as it took to get in it. </p></blockquote><p>But the work is important, and we can continue to get better at it.</p><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>#1: Peacemaking requires both Reconciliation <em><strong>and</strong></em> Justice</p><p>A common theme through the stories is that these two objectives are dependent on one another:</p><blockquote><p>Reconciliation that isn't interested in the injustices that are dividing people is shallow at best and sinister at worst. And any effort at justice that addresses the basic needs of security and sustenance but pays little attention to the quality of compassionate relationship between people is like trying to build the frame of a ship without any adhesive.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>There's something about the language of reconciliation that can seem friendlier to those in power and an enemy to those suffering, while language of justice may be the exact opposite.</p></blockquote><p>Those of us with power must be willing to admit it and learn to share it if we hope to make lasting progress:</p><blockquote><p>…<em>true</em> reconciliation threatens the power structures. Reconciliation needs to be dealing with creating healthy, right relationships, which must mean dealing with power imbalances. Inequality in power, access, distribution of resources—all these tear at any hope of deep relationship.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>#2: “Free the oppressed and you might free the oppressor too”</p><p>Obviously the oppressed need to be freed, but how about the oppressor? You may have heard this sort of idea before, but could have had trouble visualizing it or making it concrete.</p><p>There are a couple ways in which even the perpetrators of harm need to be freed:</p><p><strong>First,</strong> they can be freed to regain their humanity. Continuing to uphold systems of harm degrades one’s ethical and moral center. It burdens the soul. It is an albatross.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, they can be freed from constant vigilance: </p><blockquote><p>“…but I fear they will kill us if we don't control them. It's the cost of security.”</p></blockquote><p>Those who uphold systems of oppression have a background anxiety that people who’ve been harmed are going to come “settle up”. This fear and constant vigilance often leads to things such as:</p><ul><li><p>additional spending or effort on security</p></li><li><p>isolation and conclaving</p></li><li><p>reactionary measures and escalations</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Walls like these often rise in response to fear.... But I think walls become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p></blockquote><p>Our freedoms are bound together.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have you read this book? What takeaways did you have?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Definitions</h2><p>The book detailed a few terms that are worth sharing:</p><ul><li><p>“single stories” - stories that strip complexity from people and reduce them to narratives without nuance (source: <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>)</p></li><li><p>“single identity work” - the work that groups should do within the group, before working with other groups where there is conflict (this is the group version of “work on yourself, first”)</p></li><li><p>“contact hypothesis” - the (disbunked) idea that just getting to know people will solve or prevent conflicts</p></li><li><p>“sulha” - seeking to dismantle the occupation and secure freedom through nonviolence (source: Usama, a Palestinian interviewed for the book)</p></li><li><p>“refuseniks” - Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in occupied Palestine (<em>note: there are other historical uses of this term as well, and it can also mean Israeli conscientious objectors more generally) </em></p></li></ul><h2>Additional Quotes</h2><blockquote><p>What makes for peace is the capacity to live with difference in such a way that bears fruit rather than arms. Difference and disagreement are guaranteed for human relationships. More often than not, it's how we <em>deal with</em> difference, rather than <em>being</em> different, that determines our potential to be peaceable.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>The stories we tell either help us or harm us. No narrative is neutral. The ones that help are usually ones that tell bold truths about our world, even painful ones, because we always need to face the truth with courage if we're to heal and grow. The ones that hurt are usually ones that distort truths—maybe to protect power, or dehumanize, or tempt us to weaponize our fear. We humans tend to do our worst when we're afraid. Fear leads to hatred and hatred leads to violence and violence leads to fear, which leads to hatred, which leads to violence. If we don't address this deadly cycle, it can loop forever. </p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>Building empathy for the sake of empathy, however, isn’t enough. It should lead to compassionate action for improving the world....Empathy that does not lead toward constructive efforts for personal and social improvement isn't of much use to anyone.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>...religion and difference need not be markers of division. It's not written in stone anywhere that hospitality and affection shall be suspended in the company of difference. In fact, it's in the presence of difference that hospitality is often most needed.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>…everyone who benefits from an unjust system and is not actively working to dismantle it is at least partly responsible for its harm.</p></blockquote><p>What can you do to help bring reconciliation and justice?</p><p></p>\n",

Along the way, she examines the ways that she may have benefited from white privilege, and the ways she may have allowed or perpetuated racial injustices.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/\">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>\n<p>I was reading this article today from <em>the Economist</em>: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights\">“No Vaccine for Cruelty”</a> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg\">image</a>).</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.</p>\n<p>The article says &ldquo;no vaccine&rdquo;, but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let&rsquo;s give this a shot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-authoritarians-rise\">How authoritarians rise</h2>\n<p>First, by &ldquo;authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They&rsquo;re sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they&rsquo;re almost always men) or tyrants.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make everyone afraid</li>\n<li>Blame someone for it</li>\n<li>Claim to be the savior</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that&rsquo;s the vaccine!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-everyone-afraid\">Make everyone afraid</h2>\n<p>There are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that&rsquo;s genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!</p>\n<p>As you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even <strong>caused</strong> by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to <strong>do something</strong>, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n<p>First, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by <strong>being</strong> hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. <em>Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?</em></p>\n<p>Another way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (<em>sorry, that’s the topic for another post</em>), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the original source of this information?</li>\n<li>Is this mostly facts or opinions?</li>\n<li>Is this showing things in only the worst way?</li>\n<li>Who are they trying to scare?</li>\n<li>Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (<em>Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blame-someone-for-it\">Blame someone for it</h2>\n<p>The next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called &ldquo;scapegoating&rdquo; or setting up a &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It&rsquo;s a sad way to create fake togetherness. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on <em>hope</em> was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)</p>\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He&rsquo;s trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces.</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n<p>One thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us. We can live in neighborhoods where there are people with different backgrounds. We can go to schools where everybody doesn&rsquo;t look like us. We can make friends with people with different experiences than us. When we travel, we can learn from and be respectful to the people that are local to the area. We can be part of groups and activities where we meet people who think or act differently. Here&rsquo;s why: when you know people that are in the accused group, it&rsquo;s hard for someone to convince you that they are the enemy, because you&rsquo;ll be able to see that the lies and stereotypes aren&rsquo;t true.</p>\n<p>Also, along the lines of <em>hope</em> from phase 1, we can build teams, support, and organizations that serve people and solve problems.

Now the strongman makes the claim to be the savior. They tell you &ldquo;look, I know what the problems are&hellip;I warned you about them&rdquo; (back when they made people afraid) and &ldquo;I know how to solve it&hellip;I told you who is at fault&rdquo; (back when they blamed people). See what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>\n<p>They will tell you they are the only one smart enough to see it all, and strong enough to do something about it.

They represent an area where all the water drains into one body (stream, river, lake, etc.).</p><p>In the USA, the numbers you see in the above images represent the 8-digit “HUC” or Hydrologic Unit Code. From my example, 05120201 represents Ohio (05), Wabash (12), Patoka-White (02), Upper White (01). As you can see, they are all named after the major river(s) of that region.</p><p>In addition to the 8-digit HUCs, there are also 12-digit HUCs, representing two additional layers of zoom-in and specificity. Using my proposed naming above, perhaps we could call these <em>Townships</em> and <em>Neighborhoods</em>. </p><h2>What are mine?</h2><p>In the USA, you can find your regions by progressively zooming in <a href=\"https://water.usgs.gov/wsc/watershed_finder.html\">via this tool from the US Geological Survey</a>. For each region, they also provide many linked resources.</p><p>To get even more specific, you can check your 12-digit HUC <a href=\"https://mywaterway.epa.gov/community\">using the community water search from the EPA</a>. This is also a great resource to see the quality of the water in your area, including the safety of swimming in it, the health of aquatic life in it, and the quality of your drinking water.</p><p>(<em>Note: if you live outside the USA, please feel free to share in the comments how to look up watersheds where you live!)</em></p><h2>Why does it matter?</h2><p>As the saying goes: <em>water is life</em>. People, wildlife, and the entire ecology within a watershed are all part of the same stream of life. </p><p>In addition, ecological health is tied to financial health, and both are affected by community interactions and governance within the region. Their fate flows together.</p><p>Thus, the thought experiment of using the terms: <em>Nation, State, County, City, Township, Neighborhood</em>.</p><p>Political boundaries can often feel arbitrary, based on agreements or impositions that may have had very little to do with the people that actually live in the area (or were even contrary to their interests, such as in colonial situations).</p><p>But watersheds are based on shared life. Regardless of wealth, ethnicity, or other factors, people within a watershed have shared destiny.</p><h2>So what?</h2><p>What would it mean to think of our local watershed as our polity, our political unit?</p><p>Could we become better at seeing our neighbors as people in the same boat, rather than as enemies?</p><p>Could we more readily identify how systems are interacting?</p><p>Could it enable more long-term thinking, strategic thinking, thinking that considers not just the current moment but the impact to the financial, social, and ecological health of the region?<br><br>How is the health of your watershed? What might you do, knowing that?</p>\n",

Why? The first reason is that in some businesses or non-business organizations, operations are either having to halt, scale way down, or even scale way up. The second is that some organizations are moving to a great amount of work from home.</p><p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibility for BCP activities:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Make sure your info/documentation is up-to-date on contacts, including the fact that people may not have access to their work phone #s</p></li>\n<li><p>Also check that you have contact info for those “jurisdictional” contacts outside your org (e.g. health, emergency services, city, county, state, etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If you rely on teams that are engaged on a retainer basis to help during crisis, verify whether they still have capacity for you, due to the widespread nature of the event</p></li>\n<li><p>As always, review any lessons you are learning along the way, so that you can create action plans to iteratively improve</p></li>\n</ul><p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibilty supporting increased Remote Work:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Make a plan for how physical assets are leaving (and eventually returning) to your physical locations</p></li>\n<li><p>If you’re not already operating on Zero Trust Networking principles, verify that critical systems require additional protection beyond requiring VPN for access (adding multifactor authentication and enhanced monitoring, for example)</p></li>\n<li><p>Evaluate your ability to continue to protect the end-user devices that are connecting to your systems: Can you keep them updated? Do you have EDR (endpoint detection and response) capabilities fully deployed? Can you define a “good” device through NAC (network access control) rules and quarantine bad devices until they meet specifications?</p></li>\n<li><p>If folks are accessing most of your systems through an online suite (such as O365, Zoho, or GSuite), evaluate those configurations towards security standards and make critical changes</p></li>\n<li><p>Work with your monitoring teams (such as NOC and SOC) to re-evaluate your expectations around what are standard behaviors and what activities need to be reviewed and/or escalated</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><h1>Society</h1><p>The safety measures we are taking will put extra strain on some segments of our society. Here are a few thoughts as we work through these times:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Avoid hoarding, so that those with great need still have access.  This goes both for physical goods but also for consumption of services and manipulation of markets.</p></li>\n<li><p>People are losing work and income during this time. Can you reach out to give or receive assistance? Maybe through a an organization you’re part of?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there people in your life that need to hear from you? Or who you need to check in with? Get a call or video chat going.</p></li>\n<li><p>As organizations do away with <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/15/what-will-happen.html\">BS, punitive, or unnecessary measures</a>, hold them accountable not to reinstate them.</p></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re a praying person, consider the following prayer. Even if you’re not, you may find the items to be good contemplative ideas to spur action and support:</p><blockquote>\n<p>May we who are merely inconvenienced<br>Remember those whose lives are at stake.</p>\n<p>May we who have no risk factors<br>Remember those most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>May we who have the luxury of working from home<br>Remember those who must choose between preserving their health or making their rent.</p>\n<p>May we who have the flexibility to care for our children when their schools close<br>Remember those who have no options.</p>\n<p>May we who have to cancel our trips<br>Remember those that have no safe place to go.</p>\n<p>May we who are losing our margin money in the tumult of the economic market<br>Remember those who have no margin at all.</p>\n<p>May we who settle in for a quarantine at home<br>Remember those who have no home.</p>\n<p>As fear grips our country,<br>let us choose love.</p>\n<p>During this time when we cannot physically wrap our arms around each other,<br>Let us yet find ways to be the loving embrace of God to our neighbors.</p>\n<p>Amen.</p>\n</blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://krugthethinker.com/2020/03/prayer-for-a-pandemic/\">Prayer for a Pandemic</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Sustainability</h1><p>As we reduce our commuting, travel, and trips around town, we have an opportunity to evaluate our behaviors, and see what habits might stick. This has the potential to reduce petroleum-based travel and move us towards renewables-based vehicles/transportation, better food-production ecosystems, and people-centered cities.</p><p>Here are some questions to ponder:</p><ul>\n<li><p>For those of you working from home, could you continue to work from home after this is over? For at least a portion of the time?</p></li>\n<li><p>Which meetings need to still exist? Which <em>of those</em> still need to be in person?</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are going outside more to get out of the house, is this building up your inspiration and capacity for walking, biking, and other people-powered transport? Could this stretch the radius in which you opt to walk or bike instead of getting in a car?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there edifying and/or relaxing places that you'd like to visit, which don’t require a plane trip?</p></li>\n<li><p>If you order in, or drive through, can you avoid the plastic utensils and containers? Maybe bring/use your own?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are you cooking more at home? Could you keep doing more of that? Are there local farmers you can support?</p></li>\n<li><p>Have you had to give up how much meat you consume? Could you keep eating less meat and fewer animal products?</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><h1>Self</h1><p>If you’re following the safety tips in the introduction, you are already doing an important part to help slow the spread and ensure that people will have access to medical care. The tips and questions in the <em>security</em>,<em> society</em>,<em> </em>and <em>sustainability</em> sections are not intended to cause panic, but rather present food for thought that could help make things better now and in the future.</p><p>Through the period of uncertainty, it’s important to continue to take care of yourself. Again, some thoughts:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Take your meds, cook good food, and stay on your plan</p></li>\n<li><p>If you work with any kind of therapist(s), see if there are options for continuing that work, maybe through video</p></li>\n<li><p>If you feel overwhelmed, call a crisis hotline if you need it (1-800-273-8255) or get help via services like betterhelp or talkspace</p></li>\n<li><p>Talk to your loved ones and your communities of support (faith and service organizations, for example)</p></li>\n<li><p>Get some exercise at home and take walks in open &amp; natural spaces</p></li>\n<li><p>Give yourself grace when you feel down</p></li>\n<li><p>Practice gratitude for the things that are going well</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><p>I hope you found this helpful. <br>Is there anything obvious we missed?

However, his early focus on  productivity is concerning to me.

				"content_text": "<p>Sunday, 13 years ago (2007), my spouse and I joined our <a href=\"http://www.indymenno.org/\">Mennonite community and church</a>.</p>\n<p>You might be surprised that a Mennonite is here on the Internet, talking about things like cybersecurity. So let me give you the world’s shortest history of Mennonites and a few quick points about modern Mennonites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p>Mennonites are descendants (sometimes literally) of the reformation, specifically, what’s often called the “radical reformation.” In that movement, the radical reformers believed that that one’s place of birth or government should not dictate one’s religion, and that one should profess their faith once they were capable of freely accepting one. For this, the label \"anabaptists” or “re-baptizers” was used as an epithet, and it stuck.</p>\n<p>Anabaptists also opted out of the violence and warring between religious and political factions, choosing to disassociate or flee to a new location, as needed. They practiced a “priesthood of all believers”, meaning that there was no formal clergy and that all were called to hold each other accountable in interpretation and life. They put a focus on Jesus’s teachings and life, not just his birth and death.</p>\n<p>None of these stories are without exception, and I could write several other posts about the asterisks. But I promised you a short history.</p>\n<p>Modern Anabaptists include Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Church of Brethren, Brethren in Christ, and several variations on all these.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modernmennonites\">Modern Mennonites</h2>\n<p>Here are what I see as the most-common traits of modern Mennonites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reconciliation: conflict mediation, healing relationships, restoring ecology, practicing redemption, disaster-relief</li>\n<li>Peacemaking: nonviolent struggles for peace &amp; justice, echoing the voices of the voiceless, reducing harm, operating from subversive &amp; prophetic weakness instead of domination</li>\n<li>Simplicity: living intentionally, being kind to animals &amp; the earth, humility, avoiding consumerism</li>\n<li>Christocentrism: viewing the whole of the Bible through the lens of Jesus’s teaching and action, seeing the image of God in our neighbors &amp; enemies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, this is very short list with exceptions omitted. If you want to read a short book with more, I’d recommend <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780836199833\">The Naked Anabaptist</a></em> or (somewhat longer) <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781513802497\">The Upside Down Kingdom</a></em>.</p>\n",

That led to a question for me about some of my top values or principles in my work. Here are four that I discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enablement: I don&rsquo;t want to be a bottleneck. My aim is to equip and empower others through education, tools, patterns, etc. so that they can take on more responsibility and help us all be more successful.</li>\n<li>Mutuality: Decisions should include the context &amp; perspectives of the stakeholders. Directly, if possible. I aim for win-win solutions.</li>\n<li>Resilience: Solutions should account for issues of scalability, safety, and sustainability. We ought to design things such that they can adapt to change in graceful ways.

My aim is to equip and empower others through education, tools, patterns, etc. so that they can take on more responsibility and help us all be more successful.\n* Mutuality: Decisions should include the context & perspectives of the stakeholders. Directly, if possible. I aim for win-win solutions.\n* Resilience: Solutions should account for issues of scalability, safety, and sustainability. We ought to design things such that they can adapt to change in graceful ways. Ideally, becoming stronger & better as they do.\n* Authenticity: I want be be open & direct without being a jerk.

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2020/655cfd3650.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n## Overview\nI set a goal of reading 63 books in 2019, which was a 10% increase over 2019. I met this goal exactly. I have again increased my goal by 10% and plan to read at least 70 books in 2020.\n\nAbout half of the books I read (31, to be exact) were non-fiction. I seek books that may be  \"eye-opening\": those that challenge my understanding, worldview, and conceptions. I look for books of criticism, history, philosophy, ethics, theology, psychology, business, economics, and politics.\n\n## How I Read\nFor nonfiction, I get the books multiple ways. If I'm not sure I'll like it and don't expect I'll need to take a lot of notes, I look for the audiobook or summary first in my [Scribd subscription](https://www.scribd.com/g/6xggmi) and then [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) (to borrow digitally from my local library). If I know I'll want to reference the book a lot after finishing it, I order a hardback via [Indiebound](https://www.indiebound.org/indie-bestsellers?aff=resilient) or [Alibris](https://www.alibris.com/). If I expect to learn a lot and/or take lots of highlights and notes, I'll borrow the ebook via Libby or buy it from an ebook seller.\n\nMy book (and article) highlights and notes from all sources go automatically into [Readwise.io](https://readwise.io/), where I review 15 highlights each day to aid in retention and reflection. This is one of the ways I start my day, and it's incredibly valuable.\n\nI rate books between ⭐️ and ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, with ⭐️⭐️⭐️ being the cutoff for a worthy book. Thus, I will only share about the ⭐️⭐️⭐️ through ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ books, here.\n\n## Recommended Books\n### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \n\n* _[How To Be An Antiracist](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525509288?aff=resilient)_ by Ibram X.

This time, I decided to start with <a href=\"https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/203657/Risus-Companion?affiliate_id=21283\">Risus</a>, a very simple system that uses ratings called “clichés”.</p>\n<p>Since we play Team Fortress 2 as a way to hangout and talk, we decided to set the game in the TF2 setting and use the TF2 classes (scout, soldier, pyro, demoman, heavy, engineer, medic, sniper, and spy) as our clichés. Having this pick list gave them enough, but not too much, variety to choose from.</p>\n<p>I used a semi-standard Risus setup of starting ratings at 4, 3, 2, 1 (for the total of 10). I also told them their agency would give them 1 basic weapon and 1 tool, or 4 tools. They both chose the first option. (Maybe I should have made it 5 tools, as it didn’t seem like a hard choice but for them.) They also picked code names and their “real names”.  I encouraged them not to have the same things as each other in 3 and 4. Their characters started off like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Codename</strong>: Z7\n<strong>Real name</strong>: Megan\n<strong>4</strong>: Engineer\n<strong>3</strong>: Scout\n<strong>2</strong>: Spy\n<strong>1</strong>: Heavy\n<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: shotgun\n<strong>Tool</strong>: Wrench</p>\n<p><strong>Codename</strong>: H6\n<strong>Real name</strong>: Jace\n<strong>4</strong>: Heavy\n<strong>3</strong>: Pyro\n<strong>2</strong>: Scout\n<strong>1</strong>: Sniper\n<strong>Basic Weapon</strong>: rifle\n<strong>Tool</strong>: binoculars</p>\n<p>We didn’t have enough d6s, so I used d10s. I also used the Risus variant where you look at the <em>best</em> die in the roll, instead of the total. To play, when they wanted to do something interesting with an uncertain outcome, I asked them to describe it, told them which of their cliches was appropriate, and gave them a difficulty between 6 and 10.  I also brought in the Risus conflict rules, again using versus instead of totals.</p>\n<p>I also brought in “bennies” to the system, in order to give us a little more flexibility. I awarded them 1 at the start of their mission, and told them they’d get another any time I thought they did something really interesting or clever. They could give me a bennie when they failed a roll and wanted to re-roll it. However, when I got a bennie from then, I could put it back in the pool to add a twist to the story. (In retrospect, I could have instead set it up where I “pay” it to whoever was affected by the twist, but this gets complicated when it could affect both of them.)</p>\n<p>I did one more piece of prep. I marked up a pile of note cards with “standard exits” at each cardinal direction and various paths connecting them.</p>\n<p>To play, I asked them to pick a card (from a face down spread).

Microsoft shares data that it <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-using-multi-factor-authentication-blocks-99-9-of-account-hacks/\">can block 99% of attacks</a>. </p><p>However, like Facebook before, Twitter <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/information-and-ads\">has has used those secondary security factors as marketing tools</a>. On advertising platforms (like Twitter, Google, and Facebook), advertising will always take top priority, so other factors like security may suffer.</p><p>In related news: advertising companies are also unlikely to support end-to-end encryption (<a href=\"https://freedom.press/training/blog/newsrooms-lets-talk-about-gsuite/\">as with Google</a>), and thus your data and systems are vulnerable to government interventions &amp; pressures.</p><p>Speaking of those pressures, <a href=\"https://dymaxion.org/essays/coercionresistantdesign.html\">Coercion-Resistant Design</a> refers the idea of building things such that it’s harder for outside parties to force you to subvert the security of your system, whether due to “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis\">rubber hose-cryptanalysis</a>”, nation-state impositions, extortion, or any other type of coercion. In the linked article, Elanor Saitta considers many angles on how to build in coercion-resistance. </p><div><hr></div><p>In <a href=\"http://www.davefarley.net/?p=285\">Continuous Compliance</a>, Dave Farley talks about how teams might build in compliance verification into their CI/CD processes. As IT auditors frequently lag behind technology trends, this is one way to build in compliance requirements and demonstrate them in a way that is understandable. </p><div><hr></div><p>The FBI’s warrantless searches <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-court-fbi-warrantless-searches-were-illegal\">have been declared illegal</a>. This is good news, as searches need to be:</p><ul><li><p>Based on cause</p></li><li><p>More targeted</p></li><li><p>Given strong oversight</p></li></ul><p>As stated in the news article, though, this is not the end of the struggle to make this program safer.</p><h1>Sustainability</h1><p>More research and planning is needed, but it looks like <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/08/20/gassy.html\">adding a small amount of a certain type of seaweed to cattle feed will have a major impact on methane emisssions</a>, and thus greenhouse gases.  </p><div><hr></div><p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzykq/you-dont-need-an-iphone-11-unless-your-current-phone-is-literally-unusable\">The practically, morally, and financially responsible thing to do is to use your current phone for as long as possible.</a> This is an important reminder when new devices come out. Similar for cars, continuing to service whatever you have is better for sustainability than the making of a new one, even if that new one is zero emissions once it gets on the road.</p><div><hr></div><p>I was totally unaware of the <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a26038/the-blood-of-the-crab/\">role that horseshoe crabs play in our medical system</a>. Hopefully we can find another way to meet these needs.</p><h1>Society</h1><p>Over at Waging Nonviolence, they <a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/2019/08/right-wing-media-creating-antifa-shooter-narrative-out-of-thin-air/\">demonstrate how pundits and politicians fabricate narratives</a>, by examining the news cycle of how antifascists got scapegoated as the “real danger”, instead of the fascists that they organize against.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p>No wonder we’re all so skeptical and cynical these days. Because we have a million good A/B-optimized reasons to be.</p></blockquote><p>A quote from “<a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/lets-stop-shaking-people-down-for-their-email-addresses/\">let’s stop shaking people down for their email addresses</a>”, where the folks at Basecamp once again bring some much-needed simplicity and intentionality to business.</p><h1>Self</h1><p><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Ei1A7l8W8\">Leading Above the Line</a> is another great interview of Jim Dethmer.</p><div><hr></div><p>A personal reflection on minimalism and loss: <a href=\"https://nosidebar.com/the-best-tribute/\">“what if minimalism is the best tribute to a memory or person?”</a></p><div><hr></div><p>A short video from Aeon: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/time-seems-to-accelerate-as-we-get-older-but-theres-a-tested-way-to-tap-the-brakes\">on time-perception and aging</a>.

The drafters of the resolution received help from Iglesia Menonita Hispana, delegates, and the resolutions committee. It has the support of the Executive board and sufficient delegate signatures to be brought to the delegates.</p>\n<p>As the resolution was read to the delegates, it ended with a standing ovation. <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0\">You can read the text here.</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>We had another equipping study with Tom Yoder Neufeld. This time, we continued into chapters 4-6 of Ephesians, and how we live in God’s blessing.</p>\n<p>Tom tells us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not walk alone</li>\n<li>God walks with us</li>\n<li>We walk with others</li>\n<li>The unity of the Spirit is the <em>basis</em> not the <em>result</em> of walking together well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we exhibit the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humility</li>\n<li>Patience</li>\n<li>Suffering each other (forbearance)</li>\n<li>Forgiveness (gracing each other as God has graced us)</li>\n<li>Seeing the face of God in each other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the wording and imagery of the text, Tom imagines us as “chain gang of peace”, trying to run together, like in the poster for <em>O Brother Where Art Thou?</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>We should be patient “seventy times seven”, but if bonds break, it should be with “grief” not “good riddance.”</p>\n<p>Tom reminds us that “the unity of the Spirit is bigger, wider, and deeper than any of our organizational structures.”</p>\n<p>In Q&amp;A, we were reminded that the pain is often on the party in the margins or minority. But we need to put the greater burden on the side with power, not the other way around.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Next, we discussed the proposal to formally add youth delegates (aged 16-21). This would include 1 per congregation, 2 per conference, and 2 per racial-ethnic constituency group.</p>\n<p>It was clarified that current delegates can come from this age group, but that this codifies adding some specifically of that age range.</p>\n<p>The measure passed nearly-unanimously with only 6 of 495 delegates dissenting.</p>\n<p>I interviewed one of those dissenting, later. They were not against youth being delegates, only the way it was being implemented (as additional count and bylaw changes). They were afraid it cemented that youth are separate and different, rather than integrating them more. They would have preferred we simply passed a resolution granting Step Up members voting status.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In the afternoon session, we discussed the leadership discernment slate. The Gifts Discernment team worked to fill roles at least 50% women, and at least 20% people of color. The slate had 48% women and 40% people of color.</p>\n<p>After reviewing <a href=\"http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nominee-info-and-pics-for-KC-2019.pdf\">the slate</a>, they were approved unanimously.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Glen Guyton presented the plan for a new communications strategy. It would focus on a unified identity-building communications approach for MCUSA. It would also include <em>The Mennonite</em> going independent from MCUSA and joining <em>Mennonite World Review</em>.</p>\n<p>I personally expressed concerns about how <em>The Mennonite</em> needing to become financially self-sustainable could lead to commercialization and the related negative effects that commercialization has on news. From Glen’s response, it sounds like those factors are being considered.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In addition to the youth delegate changes to the bylaws, we also reviewed the other adjustments to the bylaws, <a href=\"http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf\">which you can read here</a>.</p>\n<p>These changes (including removing a reference to telegram!) were passed unanimously.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Next, Michael Danner led a discussion on the membership guidelines, so that the executive board could get a sense of how our constituencies are feeling about handling membership guidelines.</p>\n<p>We were asked to score both how important amending the guidelines is to our constituencies, and then how much energy we have to put into it over the next two years.</p>\n<p>They also asked for our comments. Several comments from my table and others mentioned that the <a href=\"https://www.bmclgbt.org/\">Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pinkmenno.org/\">Pink Menno</a> have people willing to advise on the process and wording for the guidelines. This would help limit some of the effort and pain that might otherwise have to be played out in local churches. As we discussed above, we want less of the burden to fall on those with less power.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Both worship services today focused on the movement of the Spirit, a topic that may have felt uncomfortable for some Mennonites. But the Energy, the Breath, the Wind blew through our worship space, surprising us with new things.</p>\n",

[You can read the text here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0)\n\n---\n\nWe had another equipping study with Tom Yoder Neufeld. This time, we continued into chapters 4-6 of Ephesians, and how we live in God’s blessing.\n\nTom tells us: \n\n* We do not walk alone\n* God walks with us\n* We walk with others\n* The unity of the Spirit is the *basis* not the *result* of walking together well\n\nAnd we exhibit the following characteristics:\n\n* Humility\n* Patience\n* Suffering each other (forbearance)\n* Forgiveness (gracing each other as God has graced us)\n* Seeing the face of God in each other\n\nUsing the wording and imagery of the text, Tom imagines us as “chain gang of peace”, trying to run together, like in the poster for _O Brother Where Art Thou?_ \n<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/2bb0a96cb9.jpg\" width=\"408\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nWe should be patient “seventy times seven”, but if bonds break, it should be with “grief” not “good riddance.”\n\nTom reminds us that “the unity of the Spirit is bigger, wider, and deeper than any of our organizational structures.”\n\nIn Q&A, we were reminded that the pain is often on the party in the margins or minority. But we need to put the greater burden on the side with power, not the other way around. \n\n---\n\nNext, we discussed the proposal to formally add youth delegates (aged 16-21). This would include 1 per congregation, 2 per conference, and 2 per racial-ethnic constituency group. \n\nIt was clarified that current delegates can come from this age group, but that this codifies adding some specifically of that age range.\n\nThe measure passed nearly-unanimously with only 6 of 495 delegates dissenting.\n\nI interviewed one of those dissenting, later. They were not against youth being delegates, only the way it was being implemented (as additional count and bylaw changes). They were afraid it cemented that youth are separate and different, rather than integrating them more. They would have preferred we simply passed a resolution granting Step Up members voting status. \n\n---\nIn the afternoon session, we discussed the leadership discernment slate. The Gifts Discernment team worked to fill roles at least 50% women, and at least 20% people of color. The slate had 48% women and 40% people of color. \n\nAfter reviewing [the slate](http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nominee-info-and-pics-for-KC-2019.pdf), they were approved unanimously. \n\n---\n\nGlen Guyton presented the plan for a new communications strategy. It would focus on a unified identity-building communications approach for MCUSA. It would also include _The Mennonite_ going independent from MCUSA and joining _Mennonite World Review_.\n\nI personally expressed concerns about how _The Mennonite_ needing to become financially self-sustainable could lead to commercialization and the related negative effects that commercialization has on news. From Glen’s response, it sounds like those factors are being considered.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to the youth delegate changes to the bylaws, we also reviewed the other adjustments to the bylaws, [which you can read here](http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf).\n\nThese changes (including removing a reference to telegram!) were passed unanimously.\n\n---\n\nNext, Michael Danner led a discussion on the membership guidelines, so that the executive board could get a sense of how our constituencies are feeling about handling membership guidelines. \n\nWe were asked to score both how important amending the guidelines is to our constituencies, and then how much energy we have to put into it over the next two years.\n\nThey also asked for our comments. Several comments from my table and others mentioned that the [Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests](https://www.bmclgbt.org/) and [Pink Menno](http://www.pinkmenno.org/) have people willing to advise on the process and wording for the guidelines. This would help limit some of the effort and pain that might otherwise have to be played out in local churches. As we discussed above, we want less of the burden to fall on those with less power.\n\n---\n\nBoth worship services today focused on the movement of the Spirit, a topic that may have felt uncomfortable for some Mennonites. But the Energy, the Breath, the Wind blew through our worship space, surprising us with new things.\n",

During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful.

For each technology you reintroduce, determine <em>what value it serves</em> in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"taking-the-break\">Taking the Break:</h2>\n<p>Evaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Newport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.</p>\n<p>Two methods to “take a break” are <strong>bans</strong> and <strong>operating procedures</strong>. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. <em>Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"reintroducing-technologies\">Reintroducing Technologies</h2>\n<p>To be reintroduced, a technology must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serve something you <em>deeply</em> value</li>\n<li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value</li>\n<li>Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”</p>\n<h1 id=\"practices\">Practices</h1>\n<p>One of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.</p>\n<p>Thus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”</p>\n<p>During your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-spend-time-alone\">Practice Area: Spend Time Alone</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Solitude Deprivation</em>: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Time with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine &amp; regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.</p>\n<p>Newport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.</p>\n<p>Thus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.</p>\n<p>Through these practices, Newport recommends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Conversation Centric Communication</em>: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship&hellip;.Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information&hellip;. Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On to the practices:</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-leave-your-phone-at-home\">Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home</h3>\n<p>It may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling.

Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-join-something\">Practice: Join Something</h3>\n<p>Join a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-follow-leisure-plans\">Practice: Follow Leisure Plans</h3>\n<p>This may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.</p>\n<p>Newport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-join-the-attention-resistance\">Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance</h2>\n<p>At this point in history, “extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-delete-social-media-from-your-phone\">Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone</h3>\n<p>Once you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-turn-your-devices-into-single-purpose-computers\">Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers</h3>\n<p>This is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-use-social-media-like-a-professional\">Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional</h3>\n<p>People who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-embrace-slow-media\">Practice: Embrace Slow Media</h3>\n<p>Slow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780830841141\">Slow Church</a> movement.\nEmbrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.</p>\n<p>Avoid junk and reactivity.

				"content_text": "[Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780525536512) by Cal Newport ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_(Note: I wrote about my own experience with Digital Declutter [here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/03/06/digital-declutter-the.html).)_\n\n# Premise\nYou’ve probably already heard: billions of dollars are spent on psychology and technology to claim as much of your attention as possible, to sell as much advertisement possible. The addictiveness of sites, apps, and phones is not an accident, but rather a result carefully engineered to be just so.\n\nIn addition, “darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts”, so we are pushed towards outrage, anxiety, and despair.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to lessen the negative side effects and addictive properties of modern attention-economy technologies, but they’ve largely been unsustainable. \n\nWhat to do? Newport Recommends **Digital Minimalism**.\n\n# Manifesto\n_Digital Minimalism_ - _A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else._\n\nDigital Minimalism includes avoiding “low-value activities that can clutter up [our] time and attention and end up hurting more than they help.” It also means asking ourselves “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” The law of diminishing returns also applies, here.\n\n## The Principles\n1. Clutter is costly\n2. Optimization is important\n3. Intentionality is satisfying\n\nSummary quote from this section:\n\n> The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.\n\n# Digital Declutter Program\nNewport recommends an intentional process to reassess your needs and values.\n\n> Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will _take a break from optional technologies_ in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, _reintroduce optional technologies_ into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine _what value it serves_ in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value. \n\n## Taking the Break:\nEvaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:\n\n> consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.\n\nNewport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.\n\nTwo methods to “take a break” are **bans** and **operating procedures**. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.\n\nIn summary:\n\n> In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. _Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day._\n\n## Reintroducing Technologies\nTo be reintroduced, a technology must:\n\n1. Serve something you _deeply_ value\n2. Be the _best_ way to use technology to serve this value\n3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it\n\nFor the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”\n\n# Practices\nOne of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.\n\nThus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”\n\nDuring your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.\n\n## Practice Area: Spend Time Alone\nOne of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:\n\n> _Solitude Deprivation_: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds\n\nTime with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine & regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.\n\nNewport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.\n\nThus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.\n\nThrough these practices, Newport recommends:\n\n> _Conversation Centric Communication_: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship....Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information.... Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.\n\nOn to the practices:\n\n### Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home\nIt may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)\n\n### Practice: Take Long Walks\nBy yourself. Without your phone.\n\n### Practice: Write Letters to Yourself\nAKA write in notebooks.

Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts. \n\n### Practice: Hold Conversation Office Hours\nPick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations. \n\n## Practice Area: Reclaim Leisure\nAll this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.\n\nHere are the three principles, then, of leisure:\n\n1. Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption\n2. Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world\n3. Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions\n\n“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”\n\n### Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week\nPer principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.\n\n### Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality Leisure\nPer your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.\n\n### Practice: Join Something\nJoin a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!\n\n### Practice: Follow Leisure Plans\nThis may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.\n\nNewport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning. \n\n> A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.\n\n> For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.\n\n## Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance\nAt this point in history, “extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”\n\n### Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone\nOnce you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.\n\n### Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers\nThis is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”\n\n### Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional\nPeople who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.\n\n> Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”\n\nFor example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.\n\n### Practice: Embrace Slow Media\nSlow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or [Slow Church](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780830841141) movement. \nEmbrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.\n\nAvoid junk and reactivity. Avoid “Breaking News”, which is almost always low-quality, error-prone, and often emotionally manipulative. \n\nSeek opposing viewpoints. Follow feeds from good writers. Save/bunch stories to read once a week. \n\n### Practice: Dumb Down Your Smartphone\nConsider a dumbphone, no phone, or something like the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) or the [Punkt Phone](https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/).\n\n# Conclusion\nI liked this book and look forward to implementing my break and examination during Lent. Want to discuss the book? Message me and let’s have a conversation!\n\n[#DigitalMinimalism](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/digital-minimalism/)\n",

Along the way, Neil Goodrich wrote actual play reports as stylized fiction, and the rest of the players contributed some content, as well. \n\nNow, Neil has bound that content together as a beautiful book. Totaling 608 pages, it's even larger than _Burning Wheel_ itself. <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/dee4bd526f.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"mp-photo-alt[]=mp-photo-alt[]=mp-photo-alt[]=mp-photo-alt[]=\" />\n\nInside, you'll find a map of the Braemar Penninsula (courtesy of [John Love](http://johnlovesart.com/)) <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/0fcef14811.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"450\" alt=\"\" />\n\nAlso, a commissioned picture of the cast (from [Marcin S](https://plus.google.com/u/0/100711240595932728892/posts/Hnh4sKDKW8j)),<img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/578f9875f5.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"391\" alt=\"\" />\n\nIt even includes stylized starting and ending character descriptions & sheets.\n\nAs we start to go back through the fiction, it's amazing to see how much foreshadowing there is about how the situation and the characters will turn out.\n\nBecause it was my character, I've included pictures of how Gyles started out. How he ended was an entirely different picture…. <img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/a08dd76f94.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" /><img src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2019/1a7cec6f3d.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nI am really excited about this book. Ask me anything!\n\n",

It's been one of my favorite works for several years. Here's one of our readings from today:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: 'Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.' In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: 'Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.' And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Reminder: the key ingredient is violent power.</p>\n<p>People are often jerks. People sometimes have frightening opinions. People do things we dislike. People can be ignorant, sometimes willfully so. People are frequently selfish.</p>\n<p>These are problematic, so we seek empathy and enlightenment. And it is good that we do.</p>\n<p>But the above are not truly damaging unless they attached to violent power.</p>\n<p>Without violent power, these issues are an opportunity for discussion and learning.</p>\n<p>But when backed by the ability to call on armed men &amp; women, the ability capture &amp; hold people, the ability to acquire with force, and the ability to strike and kill: they become coercive and potentially deadly.</p>\n<p>We cannot and should not stop educating. We cannot and should not stop furthering socialization and empathy.</p>\n<p>But we also need to be more focused on limiting violent power and the systems that coordinate it. Too often we excuse the amassing of violent power because it is done by someone with a friendly face or someone agreeable to our causes.</p>\n<p>History tells us time and again that such violent power will always be abused eventually.</p>\n<p>Immediacy is not an excuse to trust it. Tribalism is not an excuse to trust it with “our side.”</p>\n<p>We must fight being distracted by opinions and strike at the root.</p>\n<p>Fight the power.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"16299211_791986515803_2111440063166209939_n.jpg\" src=\"https://cdn.uploads.micro.blog/2363/2022/eb2329212c.jpg\" alt=\"16299211 791986515803 2111440063166209939 n\" width=\"337\" height=\"479\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",
