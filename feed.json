There will be a king over us! 20 We will be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us and lead us[e] and fight our battles.”\r&10;\r&10;21 So Samuel listened to everything the people said and then reported it to the Lord.[f] 22 The Lord said to Samuel, “Do as they say[g] and install a king over them.” Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Each of you go back to his own city.”\">\n",
