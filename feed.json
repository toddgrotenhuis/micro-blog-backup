				"title": "White Male Fear: The Insecurity Behind Hunting Culture",
				"content_html": "<p><em>We saw some 🦌 this morning and my friend reflected that “white tail deer” sounds like “white male fear”, so here’s an essay courtesy of GPT.</em></p>\n\n<p>Hunting has long been a popular pastime in many parts of the world, and in the United States, hunting culture is often associated with a specific demographic: white men. While some may view hunting as a harmless activity, it is important to acknowledge the underlying psychological and cultural factors that drive this activity. Specifically, hunting culture is often driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males.</p>\n\n<p>At its core, hunting is about exerting control over the natural world. Hunters seek to demonstrate their dominance over animals, proving their strength and skill in the process. For many white men, this desire for control reflects a deeper fear of losing power and status in society. In a world where white male privilege is being challenged, hunting becomes a way to reassert dominance over nature, and by extension, over other people.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, hunting is often marketed as a way to reconnect with nature and escape the stresses of modern life. However, this idealized version of hunting is often at odds with the reality of the activity. In many cases, hunting involves the use of high-powered weapons and technology that provide hunters with a significant advantage over their prey. This emphasis on technology and efficiency further underscores the need to prove one&rsquo;s dominance and control.</p>\n\n<p>The culture surrounding hunting also reinforces this sense of insecurity and fear. Hunting is often depicted as a rite of passage for young men, a way to prove their worth and masculinity. The emphasis on strength and skill reinforces traditional gender roles, and the culture of competition that surrounds hunting encourages men to measure their worth against others.</p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, hunting culture is driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males.

				"content_text": "_We saw some 🦌 this morning and my friend reflected that “white tail deer” sounds like “white male fear”, so here’s an essay courtesy of GPT._\n\nHunting has long been a popular pastime in many parts of the world, and in the United States, hunting culture is often associated with a specific demographic: white men. While some may view hunting as a harmless activity, it is important to acknowledge the underlying psychological and cultural factors that drive this activity. Specifically, hunting culture is often driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males.\n\nAt its core, hunting is about exerting control over the natural world. Hunters seek to demonstrate their dominance over animals, proving their strength and skill in the process. For many white men, this desire for control reflects a deeper fear of losing power and status in society. In a world where white male privilege is being challenged, hunting becomes a way to reassert dominance over nature, and by extension, over other people.\n\nFurthermore, hunting is often marketed as a way to reconnect with nature and escape the stresses of modern life. However, this idealized version of hunting is often at odds with the reality of the activity. In many cases, hunting involves the use of high-powered weapons and technology that provide hunters with a significant advantage over their prey. This emphasis on technology and efficiency further underscores the need to prove one's dominance and control.\n\nThe culture surrounding hunting also reinforces this sense of insecurity and fear. Hunting is often depicted as a rite of passage for young men, a way to prove their worth and masculinity. The emphasis on strength and skill reinforces traditional gender roles, and the culture of competition that surrounds hunting encourages men to measure their worth against others.\n\nIn conclusion, hunting culture is driven by a sense of insecurity and fear, particularly among white males. While the activity may be marketed as a way to reconnect with nature or assert dominance over animals, the underlying psychological and cultural factors are rooted in a desire for control and a fear of losing power and status. By acknowledging these underlying factors, we can begin to have more honest and nuanced conversations about the role of hunting in our society, and work towards a more equitable and sustainable relationship with the natural world.\n",

Most books I borrow digitally, but there are exceptions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Books I plan to re-read</li>\n<li>Deluxe or art-filled editions</li>\n<li>Books I will use as a referenrce</li>\n<li>Books I enjoyed and want to keep around</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For those cases, I get physical editions via <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis\">Bookshop</a>. And lest you think I don&rsquo;t really do physical books: my household has <strong>15</strong> brimming bookshelves.</p>\n\n<p>I take copious highlights and notes, and save them to Readwise. <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/04/09/being-wise-with.html\">Here&rsquo;s how.</a> Highlights and notes are especially important for me with digital books, where spacial-temporal recollection is not as easy, but spaced-repitition and note-linking can make up for it (and then some).</p>\n\n<p>I track my reading in <a href=\"https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/toddgrotenhuis\">The StoryGraph</a>. I prefer it because <em>not Amazon</em> and because it incorporates some data elements <strong>other than ratings</strong> which are useful for describing and finding books. I&rsquo;m hoping micro.blog&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves\">bookshelves</a> feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn&rsquo;t handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we&rsquo;ll see what the future holds.)</p>\n\n<p>I keep my to-read/wishlist as a <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd\">Bookshop list</a>, for ease of sharing and gift-giving.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"the-books\">The Books</h1>\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the recommended ones, collected in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/2022-recommendations-df1ac3a8-3069-4570-bcb2-9cfddd6c9504\">this Bookshop collection</a> or visually:</p>\n\n<p><img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2023/6295596f30.png\" alt=\"20222books\" title=\"20222books.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"568\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n\n<p>And here are <strong>all</strong> the books I read, individually, and in reading order (within rating):</p>\n\n<p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Six Deaths of the Saint (Into Shadow #3) - Alix E.

				"content_text": "Welcome to my yearly summary of books!\n\nTable of contents:\n\n- Intro - my process and tools\n- The Books - which books I recommend\n- Analysis - some introspection and goalsetting\n- Previously - links to prior years\n\n_Note: I will use Bookshop [affiliate links](/affiliate/) when available, throughout this post. You don't have to buy from my bookshop, but if you do, I put that money back into more books._\n\n# Intro\n\nI use and recommend [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) for getting ebooks and audiobooks from the library. Most books I borrow digitally, but there are exceptions:\n\n* Books I plan to re-read\n* Deluxe or art-filled editions\n* Books I will use as a referenrce\n* Books I enjoyed and want to keep around\n\nFor those cases, I get physical editions via [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis). And lest you think I don't really do physical books: my household has **15** brimming bookshelves.\n\nI take copious highlights and notes, and save them to Readwise. [Here's how.](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/04/09/being-wise-with.html) Highlights and notes are especially important for me with digital books, where spacial-temporal recollection is not as easy, but spaced-repitition and note-linking can make up for it (and then some). \n\nI track my reading in [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/toddgrotenhuis). I prefer it because _not Amazon_ and because it incorporates some data elements **other than ratings** which are useful for describing and finding books. I'm hoping micro.blog's [bookshelves](https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves) feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn't handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we'll see what the future holds.)\n\nI keep my to-read/wishlist as a [Bookshop list](https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd), for ease of sharing and gift-giving.\n\n# The Books\n\nLet's start with the recommended ones, collected in [this Bookshop collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/2022-recommendations-df1ac3a8-3069-4570-bcb2-9cfddd6c9504) or visually: \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2023/6295596f30.png\" alt=\"20222books\" title=\"20222books.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"568\" height=\"600\" />\n\nAnd here are **all** the books I read, individually, and in reading order (within rating): \n\n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ :\n\n- The Six Deaths of the Saint (Into Shadow #3) - Alix E.

We should not see “surprise” with this alignment.</p>\n<p>Obviously there are <em>many exceptions</em>, and I am no proponent of either party (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/06/02/in-that-order.html\">nor in favor of “punching” in general</a>), but it is directionally true that he rightwing has been more likely to “punch down” towards those in weaker positions (e.g. immigration, poverty, sexuality, etc.) and the leftwing has been more likely to “punch up” towards those with power (e.g. monopoly, environment). <em>(All this despite the fact that people in powerful positions often feel like they are the embattled ones.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: don’t be surprised that there are factions of the right wing calling to defund law enforcement that restrains the powerful. That is the MO of much of their recent work.</p>\n",

				"title": "Being Wise with Readwise",
				"content_html": "<p>This post is about how I make the best of <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">Readwise.io</a>, a service that works with your notes and highlights to enhance <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already use Readwise, I highly recommend it! <em>You and I both get a free month with my <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">affiliate code</a>.</em> As you can see, I use Readwise consistently:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/e37a135270.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"343\" /></p>\n<p>I will cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting Things In</strong>: making all your highlights and notes available</li>\n<li><strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>: tips for capture and organizing</li>\n<li><strong>Getting Things Out</strong>: making backups and data available in your notes system</li>\n<li><strong>Working with Ideas</strong>: making the most of your highlights and notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsin\">Getting Things In</h1>\n<p>My first principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Send Everything In</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, I want <em>all</em> my reading notes and highlights to end up in Readwise. I even want to supplement my notes and highlights with those that <em>others</em> are making! The system grows in value as more of your important items are included, both because of your ability to search the content and because of the network effects from different notes being available together. (We’ll explore this more in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>).</p>\n<p>Here are the steps:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1.connectallyourservices\">1. Connect All Your Services</h2>\n<p>Once you have an account, head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a> and turn on connections for any services you use.</p>\n<p>For me, that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all the places I read digital books (Kindle, Apple Books, Libby, and Kobo)</li>\n<li>all the places I read things other than books (Instapaper/Pocket, Twitter, Medium, Web Highlights, <a href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\">Inoreader</a>/<a href=\"https://feedly.com\">Feedly</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> service from Readwise)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might use other services and want to connect other them as well. Some additional examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airr.io\">Airr</a> - podcasts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com\">Shortform</a> - book summaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<em>Side Note:</em> Some of the connectors might even inspire you to try a new service, so Readwise has started partnerships offering discounts on services.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.importotherhighlights\">2. Import Other Highlights</h2>\n<p>Not everything has a connector, yet. Even so, there is still probably an option to get those highlights and notes into Readwise. These options are also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p>For physical books, I use the mobile app (<a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/m88AXbvcygb\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/E0AsXt7lIgb\">Android</a>) and its OCR to import from my notes and highlights. Another alternative is the CSV or Email import option. I <em>always</em> add the location or page # field, because the structure and order of the highlights is often helpful later on (for context, etc.)</p>\n<p>There are other non-connector imports as well, such as pdfs, Scribd, O’Reilly, Google Play Books, and “my clippings” for direct files in your Kindle.</p>\n<p>You might even use the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/api_deets\">API</a> to meet your needs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our API supports creating, fetching, and updating highlights on behalf of the user.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3.getotherpeopleshighlights\">3. Get Other People’s Highlights</h2>\n<p>What if I finished a book a while ago and didn’t take highlights or notes? What if I listened to an audiobook? Maybe I just want to see other Readwise users’ highlights?</p>\n<p>In these cases, you can use the “Supplemental Books” feature, also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: if you connect Goodreads in <strong>Step 1</strong>, everything you finish in Goodreads will automatically get added as a supplemental book in Readwise.</p>\n<p>I do not use Goodreads anymore, so when I finish a non-fiction book where I didn’t take highlights or notes, I head over to the Supplemental Books tab and add the book. If no other Readwise user has made highlights, yet, I make a note in tasks to try again later.</p>\n<p>In later sections, we’ll talk more about how these supplemental books are part of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> some publishers lock down how much you can highlight and export from a book. This is not a Readwise problem, but it does affect Readwise. Just in case I run up against limits, I make a habit not to make really long highlights nor to over-highlight a book. These are generally good practices, anyway, as they limit your highlights to readable sections and just the really good stuff.</p>\n<h1 id=\"makinghighlightsandnotes\">Making Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<p>The second principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Start Simple</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section will includes tips for how to use more advanced highlighting and note-taking features, but you can <em>ignore it entirely</em> or start using the tips as they help you. You might have a finely-honed method that you don’t wan’t to disturb. <em>That’s fine</em>: start there. Come back here went you want to use new features or enhance your process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizing\">Organizing</h2>\n<p>When you’ve highlighted & annotated a long document or book, you’ll automatically have all those notes available to you, whether in the collection on the web, in daily review, or in your exports. But if you’re like me, you’d like to <strong>have a bit more structure</strong>, when you are looking at the overall document highlights.</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>headings</strong> come in.</p>\n<p>Headings allow you to structure your highlights at three different heading levels. A common pattern is to call out a <em>Part</em> as heading level 1, a <em>Chapter</em> as heading level 2, and a <em>Section</em> as heading level 3. Then, you’ll have a nice table-of-contents and structure for your notes.</p>\n<p>To use this organizational structure, add a note of “.h1”, “.h2”, or “.h3” to the highlight that you want to turn into a heading. The period before the “h” tells Readwise to treat your note as a tag, not your commentary, and it then processes the highlight as a heading instead of a normal highlight.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example from <em><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/07/05/finished-reading-lean.html\">Lean Software Development</a></em> where I used heading 1 for chapters and heading 2 for agile Tools and “Try This” activities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/74241a09e2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: I generally avoid using heading 3. It is often too much. Make the choice based on your document and whether you’ll get value out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: this is one area of Readwise that has some bugs remaining. Because the header tags get applied a special way, it’s important to enter the tags accurately and in order as you work through the document. I have some books where the heading structure is messed up and it’s not something you can fix fully in the web app. When this happens, you can delete and re-synch your book or document highlights, but this is a pain if you’ve already edited (with tags, commentary, etc.) the comments within Readwise, or already returned the digital book to the library. Hopefully this is something they are fixing in in the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> experience.</p>\n<p>Want to know more about headings? <a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/\">See their blog post on headings if you would like a more detailed explanation.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2>\n<p>You already learned about a special tag: headings. There’s another special tag: <strong>concatenation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Have you ever found a long chunk of text but really just want parts of it? Concatenation lets you highlight that way. Use “.c1”, “.c2”, “.c3” etc. notes to build a highlight that combines them. Readwise will show ellipses between the parts in the final highlight. (<a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/combine-highlights-on-the-fly/\">Read their blog post about concatenation here</a>)</p>\n<p>Normal tags are created the same way as the special ones: while highlighting, add a “.” note, followed by how you’d like to tag the highlight. For example, I use “.i” for “inbox” and “.d” for “definition”. You don’t have to use shorthand, though! Your tag can be a word (or hyphenated words), but don’t add spaces or you’ll have just completed the tag and started making a normal note.</p>\n<p>Tags will be visible anywhere you are reviewing the tagged highlight, such as during daily review or when reviewing the document. From the web, you can also go to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tags</a> , see your tags, and see all the highlights with that tag.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> as with headings, I recommend you don’t go overboard here. It’s easy to waste a lot of time on tags you won’t use. It’s easy to add them later, so feel free to be sparing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you don’t know you want to tag something while you’re highlighting, but later you decide to in one of these situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you’re reviewing highlights from a document or your daily highlights</li>\n<li>a theme has started to emerge in your highlights</li>\n<li>you’re researching a topic within your notes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s fine! You can easily add tags during daily review (“T” if you like keyboard shortcuts) or when reviewing a document. I do a lot of each of those bullets above. I now use “mental-model”, “health”, “coaching”, “reflection”, “security”, “attention”, “resilient”, and “curious” heavily, but often <em>later, during review</em>.</p>\n<p>Final tip on tags: <strong>tag conversion.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember how I said I use “.d” for definition? Those actually show up in my tags as “definition”, because I converted (merged) the tag. From the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tag view</a>, click the ellipses on a tag and rename, and all once-and-future uses of the old tag will become the become the new tag. So while reading I enter as “.d”, but I get “definition” in my highlights and notes. It’s a nice time-saving trick.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I don’t know if there is a way to undo tag conversion. I don’t see one in the web interface. I’d suggest being double-sure before you go about this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsout\">Getting Things Out</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you’re now an expert at making good highlights, tags, and notes, right? But maybe you have a favorite notes system, or you’re worried about your data. For either (or both) reasons, you’ll want to sync your highlights outside of Readwise.</p>\n<p>The third principle for Readwise, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sync Your Data</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/export\">export page</a>. There, connect your note-taking system(s) of choice, or wherever you’d like your highlights & notes to land. I have the following enabled for various reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evernote</li>\n<li>Obsidian</li>\n<li>Roam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…but you can add others like Notion or RemNote.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: this is one of the other reasons you may not want to go overboard with tags. Once your notes are syncing into one of these systems, you may decide you want to tag within your note system instead of in Readwise. Before you make that call, make sure you understand how your system handles syncs from Readwise. I still use 10–15 tags when highlighting or in Readwise, and then use wiki-style links within my notes system to cross-reference certain topics. (More on that in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>.)</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to backup any important data occasionally (and these highlights and notes are important, or you wouldn’t be making them!). The syncs you setup are a soft backup, but you can make a more direct one via the <em>CSV</em> or <em>Markdown</em> export, as well.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> you can also export just one document as markdown, when you need it. Head to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/everything\">browse</a> and from the dropdown on your document, choose “Export Highlights”.</p>\n<p><em>Another Note:</em> At this time, we cannot export highlights from <em>Supplemental Books</em>. You only get your own highlights. Bummer! There are probably some very good reasons for this, though, such as not getting junk into your notes that you didn’t vet first!</p>\n<h1 id=\"workingwithideas\">Working with Ideas</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you have a collection of highlights and annotations and it’s backed up and available in your notes. So what? It’s no good to you if you don’t do anything with it! With that in mind, I’ll share the ways that I get the most out of what I put in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dailyreview\">Daily Review</h2>\n<p>Here’s my fourth principle for Readwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you’re still building the habit, you can use this common habit-building rule, instead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss Twice in a Row</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Review is the cornerstone of the value I receive from Readwise. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/configure/review\">Head over here to configure your review</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s my basic setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sent every morning at 7</li>\n<li>Max out (15) highlights per day</li>\n<li>Blended old/new recency rate</li>\n<li>Bonus highlights <em>off</em> (I have other good recommendation sources)</li>\n<li>Quality filter <em>off</em> (I’d prefer to fix it)</li>\n<li>“Normal” frequency for books, articles, tweets</li>\n<li>Slightly-lower frequency for “supplemental books”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You, of course, can <strong>tune these settings to suit your needs</strong>. If you’re just building the review habit, you may want to start with fewer highlights, for example, to make it easier to build the habit.</p>\n<p>During the daily review, I’m doing a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increasing retention of key points</li>\n<li>Adding tags when I see themes emerging</li>\n<li>Cleaning up and annotating</li>\n<li>Getting inspiration</li>\n<li>Making the highlights “talk to each other”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Retention (#1) happens naturally through the process, but I accelerate it. When I come across a challenging highlight or something that caught me by surprise, I hit the feedback button and choose “soon” or “later” instead of the default “someday”. This means I’m going to see that highlight again sooner.</p>\n<p>And though my overall review frequencies are balanced, I do sometimes select the dropdown on a highlight and “show this doc more often” (or less often), to tune the amount of highlights I am seeing from a certain book or article.</p>\n<p>I mentioned adding tags (#2) in <strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>. This normally happens when I’m noticing topics that I’m highlighting frequently, or which are becoming a common topic in my reading or research. I am very interested in attention and focus, so I have started tagging items related to those topics. I also read things related to health and longevity, so I have started tagging items with actionable advice. I also have two themes that are very important to me: curiosity and resilience, so I have developed tags related to those. You will come up with your own themes!</p>\n<p>Cleaning up and annotating (#3) can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removing bad or no-longer-useful highlights (using the “discard” button)</li>\n<li>fixing highlight or note errors (it happens, especially if they are ones you put in by hand or OCR, see <strong>Getting Things In</strong>)</li>\n<li>making highlights <em>within</em> the highlights (use double underscores around the part you want to highlight)</li>\n<li>adding new commentary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example would be when I don’t remember the context of a highlight, so I add a short note about what it means (perhaps after visiting the document highlights to see the surrounding highlights and structure).</p>\n<p><em>Tip</em>: Don’t feel bad about discarding highlights, especially from <em>Supplemental Books</em>, where they are someone else’s highlight. Discards don’t fully go away. Your discards go into a category named as such, and can be recovered. I’ve got 1276 discards!</p>\n<p>Regarding inspiration (#4), some highlights will make me want to start a blog post or put a task on my planner/calendar. Let your highlights provoke you!</p>\n<p>The last topic, highlight-collision (#5), is perhaps the most important, and is the reason why I max out my review to 15 highlights. I’m not just reviewing 15 highlights…I’m reviewing 15 highlights <strong>together</strong>. That means great chances for serendipity. Sometimes highlights will reinforce one another. Sometimes they will be in tension. Sometimes they will interact in such a way as to spark a new idea. These are magic moments. Dig in to what you are noticing. Add notes (either in the highlight or in your own system) about their interaction. Write a blog post. Make some art. Invent something. Run with it. <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Feel free to tell me what you learned or created.</a></p>\n<p>If you practice zettelkasten, evergreen notes, or a related system, this moment of <em>organized serendipity</em> is a good time to write connecting comments or notes. I use backlicks in Obsidian to accomplish this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookreview\">Book Review</h2>\n<p>When I’ve completed a work of non-fiction (or even a work of fiction where I took more than a handful of highlights), I like to make sure all my notes are in order. I go back to the web view and check my structure (remember <strong>Headings</strong>?), my highlights, notes, and tags.</p>\n<p>This is a good way to refresh myself of everything in the book, and is a jumpstart on spaced-repetition/retention. I may add <em>Supplemental Highlights</em> if I want to see what others highlighted, too.</p>\n<p>This is also a good time to write a <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/books/\">book</a> review, even if it’s a short one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"playfavorites\">Play Favorites</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed during your daily review, or book review, that you can mark a highlight as a favorite. Go ahead, do it!</p>\n<p>Sunday <strong>Daily Review</strong> collections are special, and will contain only favorites. This is a good way to keep coming back to the highlights that are very meaningful for you. This leads us to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"showyourwork\">Show Your Work</h2>\n<p>You can also let people subscribe to an email with a sampling of your favorites, one or more collections of tags, some combination of these, or <em>all</em> your highlights. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/@toddgrotenhuis\">Mine is set to a weekly broadcast with a sampling from my personal favorites and reflection questions.</a></p>\n<p>But what I like even more than the subscription is the share button. When you are reviewing a highlight, hit the share arrow, and you’ll be presented with a few options to present an elegant version of your highlight, like this highlight I have tagged as “reflection”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/48a152bac3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" /></p>\n<p>I often share this way during the Sunday Favorites <strong>Daily Review</strong> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/sunday-quotes/\">like these</a>). I also find these shares to be a fun way to place a highlight into my notes, especially if I’m collecting a few highlights on a topic.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the notes system where you are highlighting your notes supports it, you can publish your highlights there, as well. <em>All of my highlights are currently public, via Obsidian.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>You’ve hopefully picked up four principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On input: <strong>Send Everything In</strong></li>\n<li>On highlighting: <strong>Start Simple</strong></li>\n<li>On output: <strong>Sync Your Data</strong></li>\n<li>On usage: <strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope these will help you make the most of Readwise and help you with <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This was already very long.

I even want to supplement my notes and highlights with those that <em>others</em> are making! The system grows in value as more of your important items are included, both because of your ability to search the content and because of the network effects from different notes being available together. (We’ll explore this more in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>).</p>\n<p>Here are the steps:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1.connectallyourservices\">1. Connect All Your Services</h2>\n<p>Once you have an account, head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a> and turn on connections for any services you use.</p>\n<p>For me, that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all the places I read digital books (Kindle, Apple Books, Libby, and Kobo)</li>\n<li>all the places I read things other than books (Instapaper/Pocket, Twitter, Medium, Web Highlights, <a href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\">Inoreader</a>/<a href=\"https://feedly.com\">Feedly</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> service from Readwise)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might use other services and want to connect other them as well. Some additional examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airr.io\">Airr</a> - podcasts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com\">Shortform</a> - book summaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<em>Side Note:</em> Some of the connectors might even inspire you to try a new service, so Readwise has started partnerships offering discounts on services.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.importotherhighlights\">2. Import Other Highlights</h2>\n<p>Not everything has a connector, yet. Even so, there is still probably an option to get those highlights and notes into Readwise. These options are also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p>For physical books, I use the mobile app (<a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/m88AXbvcygb\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/E0AsXt7lIgb\">Android</a>) and its OCR to import from my notes and highlights. Another alternative is the CSV or Email import option. I <em>always</em> add the location or page # field, because the structure and order of the highlights is often helpful later on (for context, etc.)</p>\n<p>There are other non-connector imports as well, such as pdfs, Scribd, O’Reilly, Google Play Books, and “my clippings” for direct files in your Kindle.</p>\n<p>You might even use the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/api_deets\">API</a> to meet your needs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our API supports creating, fetching, and updating highlights on behalf of the user.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3.getotherpeopleshighlights\">3. Get Other People’s Highlights</h2>\n<p>What if I finished a book a while ago and didn’t take highlights or notes? What if I listened to an audiobook? Maybe I just want to see other Readwise users’ highlights?</p>\n<p>In these cases, you can use the “Supplemental Books” feature, also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: if you connect Goodreads in <strong>Step 1</strong>, everything you finish in Goodreads will automatically get added as a supplemental book in Readwise.</p>\n<p>I do not use Goodreads anymore, so when I finish a non-fiction book where I didn’t take highlights or notes, I head over to the Supplemental Books tab and add the book. If no other Readwise user has made highlights, yet, I make a note in tasks to try again later.</p>\n<p>In later sections, we’ll talk more about how these supplemental books are part of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> some publishers lock down how much you can highlight and export from a book. This is not a Readwise problem, but it does affect Readwise. Just in case I run up against limits, I make a habit not to make really long highlights nor to over-highlight a book.

With that in mind, I’ll share the ways that I get the most out of what I put in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dailyreview\">Daily Review</h2>\n<p>Here’s my fourth principle for Readwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you’re still building the habit, you can use this common habit-building rule, instead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss Twice in a Row</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Review is the cornerstone of the value I receive from Readwise. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/configure/review\">Head over here to configure your review</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s my basic setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sent every morning at 7</li>\n<li>Max out (15) highlights per day</li>\n<li>Blended old/new recency rate</li>\n<li>Bonus highlights <em>off</em> (I have other good recommendation sources)</li>\n<li>Quality filter <em>off</em> (I’d prefer to fix it)</li>\n<li>“Normal” frequency for books, articles, tweets</li>\n<li>Slightly-lower frequency for “supplemental books”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You, of course, can <strong>tune these settings to suit your needs</strong>. If you’re just building the review habit, you may want to start with fewer highlights, for example, to make it easier to build the habit.</p>\n<p>During the daily review, I’m doing a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increasing retention of key points</li>\n<li>Adding tags when I see themes emerging</li>\n<li>Cleaning up and annotating</li>\n<li>Getting inspiration</li>\n<li>Making the highlights “talk to each other”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Retention (#1) happens naturally through the process, but I accelerate it. When I come across a challenging highlight or something that caught me by surprise, I hit the feedback button and choose “soon” or “later” instead of the default “someday”. This means I’m going to see that highlight again sooner.</p>\n<p>And though my overall review frequencies are balanced, I do sometimes select the dropdown on a highlight and “show this doc more often” (or less often), to tune the amount of highlights I am seeing from a certain book or article.</p>\n<p>I mentioned adding tags (#2) in <strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>. This normally happens when I’m noticing topics that I’m highlighting frequently, or which are becoming a common topic in my reading or research. I am very interested in attention and focus, so I have started tagging items related to those topics. I also read things related to health and longevity, so I have started tagging items with actionable advice. I also have two themes that are very important to me: curiosity and resilience, so I have developed tags related to those. You will come up with your own themes!</p>\n<p>Cleaning up and annotating (#3) can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removing bad or no-longer-useful highlights (using the “discard” button)</li>\n<li>fixing highlight or note errors (it happens, especially if they are ones you put in by hand or OCR, see <strong>Getting Things In</strong>)</li>\n<li>making highlights <em>within</em> the highlights (use double underscores around the part you want to highlight)</li>\n<li>adding new commentary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example would be when I don’t remember the context of a highlight, so I add a short note about what it means (perhaps after visiting the document highlights to see the surrounding highlights and structure).</p>\n<p><em>Tip</em>: Don’t feel bad about discarding highlights, especially from <em>Supplemental Books</em>, where they are someone else’s highlight. Discards don’t fully go away. Your discards go into a category named as such, and can be recovered. I’ve got 1276 discards!</p>\n<p>Regarding inspiration (#4), some highlights will make me want to start a blog post or put a task on my planner/calendar. Let your highlights provoke you!</p>\n<p>The last topic, highlight-collision (#5), is perhaps the most important, and is the reason why I max out my review to 15 highlights. I’m not just reviewing 15 highlights…I’m reviewing 15 highlights <strong>together</strong>. That means great chances for serendipity. Sometimes highlights will reinforce one another. Sometimes they will be in tension. Sometimes they will interact in such a way as to spark a new idea. These are magic moments. Dig in to what you are noticing. Add notes (either in the highlight or in your own system) about their interaction. Write a blog post. Make some art. Invent something. Run with it. <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Feel free to tell me what you learned or created.</a></p>\n<p>If you practice zettelkasten, evergreen notes, or a related system, this moment of <em>organized serendipity</em> is a good time to write connecting comments or notes. I use backlicks in Obsidian to accomplish this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookreview\">Book Review</h2>\n<p>When I’ve completed a work of non-fiction (or even a work of fiction where I took more than a handful of highlights), I like to make sure all my notes are in order. I go back to the web view and check my structure (remember <strong>Headings</strong>?), my highlights, notes, and tags.</p>\n<p>This is a good way to refresh myself of everything in the book, and is a jumpstart on spaced-repetition/retention. I may add <em>Supplemental Highlights</em> if I want to see what others highlighted, too.</p>\n<p>This is also a good time to write a <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/books/\">book</a> review, even if it’s a short one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"playfavorites\">Play Favorites</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed during your daily review, or book review, that you can mark a highlight as a favorite. Go ahead, do it!</p>\n<p>Sunday <strong>Daily Review</strong> collections are special, and will contain only favorites. This is a good way to keep coming back to the highlights that are very meaningful for you. This leads us to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"showyourwork\">Show Your Work</h2>\n<p>You can also let people subscribe to an email with a sampling of your favorites, one or more collections of tags, some combination of these, or <em>all</em> your highlights. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/@toddgrotenhuis\">Mine is set to a weekly broadcast with a sampling from my personal favorites and reflection questions.</a></p>\n<p>But what I like even more than the subscription is the share button. When you are reviewing a highlight, hit the share arrow, and you’ll be presented with a few options to present an elegant version of your highlight, like this highlight I have tagged as “reflection”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/48a152bac3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" /></p>\n<p>I often share this way during the Sunday Favorites <strong>Daily Review</strong> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/sunday-quotes/\">like these</a>). I also find these shares to be a fun way to place a highlight into my notes, especially if I’m collecting a few highlights on a topic.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the notes system where you are highlighting your notes supports it, you can publish your highlights there, as well. <em>All of my highlights are currently public, via Obsidian.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>You’ve hopefully picked up four principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On input: <strong>Send Everything In</strong></li>\n<li>On highlighting: <strong>Start Simple</strong></li>\n<li>On output: <strong>Sync Your Data</strong></li>\n<li>On usage: <strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope these will help you make the most of Readwise and help you with <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This was already very long. Here are some advanced topics I didn’t cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Themed Reviews</li>\n<li>Flashcards</li>\n<li>Metadata</li>\n<li>Document Tags</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://read.readwise.io/\">Reader!</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Contact me</a> if you’d like to discuss any of these.</p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p><p>As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html\">2021 Product &amp; Service Recommendations</a>, I primarily use Plex + Plexamp for listening to music (and Marvis Pro on the go), and track listens in <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams\">Last.fm</a>. I listen to podcasts in Overcast.fm.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover a little bit about my listening habits, then share top albums and top podcasts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"musicoverview\">Music Overview</h1>\n<p>Here’s a rough map of my top genres over the year:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/ebef042eb8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"101\" /></p>\n<p>If none of those genres are of interest to you, you may just want to skip down to podcasts, otherwise you’re going to be scratching your head (or even recoiling) at a bunch of “weird music”.</p>\n<p>And here were the top 20 artists:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/98386352ce.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to last.fm and <a href=\"https://deardestiny.shinyapps.io/tuneR/\">tuneR</a>, I can see that three bands were new to my top 20 this year: clipping., Silent Planet, and Joyhauser.</p>\n<p>I got tuned in to clipping. via a friend on Bandcamp, but as I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/31/recommendations-watching.html\">2021 Watching recommendations</a>, became a fan after watching their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk\">NPR (actually!) Tiny Desk Concert</a>. If you start to watch the video and are like “wait, I know him”, then you’re probably right. <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>Snowpiercer</em>, and <em>Central Park</em> are just a few of Daveed Diggs’s major credits.</p>\n<p>Silent Planet has been a fave of mine for a while, so I’m surprised this was the first time they broke the top 20.

				"content_html": "<p>I started writing this on Friday the 10th, but am just now posting, because&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>🔒 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/hackers-launch-over-840000-attacks-through-log4j-flaw/\">The Log4j issue</a> is <em>really bad</em>. Security and engineering teams are scrambling to protect against attacks. The best teams started last week or weekend, but many organizations waited until Monday or later to get going. The vulnerability is once again hitting the hard problems of inventory management, 3rd-party software component management, and vendor management. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen something this bad in 20 years of being a security practitioner. The vulnerability is easy to exploit, has the worst kind of impact (it runs the attacker&rsquo;s code), and is present in many common technologies. In addition, there have been several follow-on problems identified, such as additional attacks, or weaknesses in the fixes for the attack! If you&rsquo;d like a laugh instead of cry, check <a href=\"https://log4jmemes.com\">log4j memes</a>.</p>\n\n<p>⚽️ After a really great start to the Premiere League (where they were recently top of the table) and Champions League (where they are reigning champions), <a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en\">Chelsea</a> are leaking goals and struggling at this point in the seasons. 3-3 vs. Zenit in the CL means they take 2nd spot (below Juventus), but are on to the round of 16 and matched up with Lille. They got a little lucky in the Leeds PL game to win 3-2, but tied 1-1 in what should have been an easy win at home against Everton.</p>\n\n<p>🛩 I recently had my 2nd business travel since &ldquo;the beforetimes&rdquo;. I tested when I got back and am luckily safe. I welcomed my new team members (direct and indirect reports) and honed 2022 strategy with the leaders on my team. It was good getting people together, but still feels a little strange getting back to it! In other work news, I also got the promotion I had been hoping for, bringing me to only 1 to 2 levels below my internal customers and working peers 😆. (Outside my team, I primarily work with SVPs and VPs, and am now an AVP.) Joking aside, I am thankful for the support of my leaders, who have shown trust in me and helped find funding and assistance for the important initiatives I&rsquo;ve been pushing.</p>\n\n<p>📚 My spouse and I registered for a new library.

				"content_text": "I started writing this on Friday the 10th, but am just now posting, because...\n\n🔒 [The Log4j issue](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/hackers-launch-over-840000-attacks-through-log4j-flaw/) is *really bad*. Security and engineering teams are scrambling to protect against attacks. The best teams started last week or weekend, but many organizations waited until Monday or later to get going. The vulnerability is once again hitting the hard problems of inventory management, 3rd-party software component management, and vendor management. I don't think I've seen something this bad in 20 years of being a security practitioner. The vulnerability is easy to exploit, has the worst kind of impact (it runs the attacker's code), and is present in many common technologies. In addition, there have been several follow-on problems identified, such as additional attacks, or weaknesses in the fixes for the attack! If you'd like a laugh instead of cry, check [log4j memes](https://log4jmemes.com).\n\n⚽️ After a really great start to the Premiere League (where they were recently top of the table) and Champions League (where they are reigning champions), [Chelsea](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) are leaking goals and struggling at this point in the seasons. 3-3 vs. Zenit in the CL means they take 2nd spot (below Juventus), but are on to the round of 16 and matched up with Lille. They got a little lucky in the Leeds PL game to win 3-2, but tied 1-1 in what should have been an easy win at home against Everton.\n\n🛩 I recently had my 2nd business travel since \"the beforetimes\". I tested when I got back and am luckily safe. I welcomed my new team members (direct and indirect reports) and honed 2022 strategy with the leaders on my team. It was good getting people together, but still feels a little strange getting back to it! In other work news, I also got the promotion I had been hoping for, bringing me to only 1 to 2 levels below my internal customers and working peers 😆. (Outside my team, I primarily work with SVPs and VPs, and am now an AVP.) Joking aside, I am thankful for the support of my leaders, who have shown trust in me and helped find funding and assistance for the important initiatives I've been pushing. \n\n📚 My spouse and I registered for a new library. To be honest, we mostly did it to have another library in [Libby/Overdive](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), but it turns out the library is lovely, too.

This is one part of broader habits meant to benefit my health (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/5VEculvEDoTT8x\">good sleep habits</a>, healthy eating, mental &amp; physical exercise, stress management, etc.).<br><br></div><blockquote><em>But can't you just eat keto or vegan or whatever my preferred diet is?</em></blockquote><div><em> </em></div><div>Turns out there can be great difference in people's genetics and biomes, leading to different responses to different foods.

A mobile phone is held up to the CGM to pull in the data to the CGM manufacturer's default app.<br> Levels has developed an additional app and service that enhances the base data from the CGM manufacturer. It links with Apple Health data and the CGM app data to perform enhanced reporting.<br> The Levels app takes my notes about food/drink, exercise, or other events (like stressors) and uses these data points to score those actions by looking at the blood sugar for the 2 hours following the activity (they call this a &quot;zone&quot;). Zones are scored 1-10 based on blood sugar response.

One of my friends who is a doctor said this cortisol response is why many heart attacks happen in the early morning!

I had a pretty terrible dinner one night (pizza, sport drink, cake, ice cream), and some fun exercise before and afterwards, and my blood sugar wasn't too bad! Conversely (see bullet #1), I've had morning meals that registered as really bad (a #3 score), even when they didn't include sweets.</li><li><strong><em>Order of operations - not just for math:</em></strong> what order I have my meal in makes a difference. Putting the fiber, fat, and protein at the front of a meal leads to better results than having bread, etc. up front. If there's something a little bad in the meal, having it last really does help. This is likely because the absorption rate of carbs is slowed down by the fiber, fat, and protein.</li><li><strong><em>Ice cream isn't so bad: </em></strong>Likely a corollary of the above bullet, ice cream doesn't affect my blood sugar too much. This may be my best option when having an occasional treat.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>I'm looking to see what I learn about more food, exercise, and stressor events in the coming weeks.

They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

We can end up working as hard (or harder) for those beliefs than we do trying to follow the Lamb.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" title=\"Download The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_378387804\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png\" alt=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 2x, https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br>Specifically, far too many Christians in Christendom have an unhealthy (and frankly, heretical) confusion of social conservatism and Christianity. They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don&rsquo;t necessarily add value.<br><br>To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<br><br></div><ul><li>here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result</li><li>there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own</li><li>there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work</li></ul><div><br></div><div>For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle. I&rsquo;ve been advocating for this two-step approach, but now have a different way to talk about it.<br><br></div><h1>Focus, Flow, and Joy</h1><div>We have a culture of meetings. This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<br><br>Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<br><br>We&rsquo;ve got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<br><br></div><ul><li>&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus</li><li>&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I&rsquo;ve been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We&rsquo;ve got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I&rsquo;m helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn&rsquo;t a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn&rsquo;t have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it&rsquo;s very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to speak up, that their concerns won&rsquo;t be dismissed and they won&rsquo;t be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it&rsquo;s ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won&rsquo;t be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn&rsquo;t used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div><div><br></div><div>&mdash;<br><br>I hope taking a look at these 5 ideals was helpful for you.

We've got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I'm helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn't a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn't have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it's very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it's ok to speak up, that their concerns won't be dismissed and they won't be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it's ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won't be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn't be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn't used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div><div><br></div><div>---<br><br>I hope taking a look at these 5 ideals was helpful for you.

(One can imagine decentralized systems that protect rights and rule of law, for example).

(One can imagine decentralized systems that protect rights and rule of law, for example). Nor have the authors deeply examined resource/environmental extraction and what that will mean for the future of all institutions, should our approach to natural resources not shift to an inclusive model.</blockquote><div><br>Have you read this book or one of the others that talk about why nations rise and fall?

We have to want a better world for everyone. We have to look at how improvements can make things better overall.<br><br>We don’t get there simply by being anti-. We don’t get there by treating others as enemies to be defeated. Rather, we can look to others as potential co-conspirators ready to tackle challenges together.<br><br>One way to step out of the enemy-making view is to look at a level level above the individual. What is the mood of the group? What is the spirit of the organization? What is the faith of the locality? What is the tone of the structure?<br><br>You can mix and match these words, too. The Christian Bible talks about the “principalities and the powers”. German philosophers talk about “the zeitgeist”.
