Subversion doesn’t suit people who, feeling their adjustment to life has been successful, want things to go on just as they are, or people who need support from authority assuring them that things are as they have to be. Fantasy not only asks “What if things didn’t go on just as they do?” but demonstrates what they might be like if they went otherwise—thus gnawing at the very foundation of the belief that things have to be the way they are.&quot; (Ursula K.

There are plenty of other ways to go about it. Many—such as land, wealth, commercial, or consumer taxes (any of which can be made more or less progressive)—are considerably more efficient, since creating a bureaucratic apparatus capable of monitoring citizens’ personal affairs to the degree required by an income tax system is itself enormously expensive. But this misses the real point: income tax is supposed to be intrusive and exasperating. It is meant to feel at least a little bit unfair. Like so much of classical liberalism (and contemporary neoliberalism), it is an ingenious political sleight of hand—an expansion of the bureaucratic state that also allows its leaders to pretend to advocate for small government.&quot; (David Graeber, Against Economics)\">\n",

Jesus’s paradigm for God is of a gracious, loving Father who kisses the faces of his sinful, rebellious children, but the seriousness with which he regards evil is so intense that he says it’s better to gouge your own eye out than to objectify women. One thing makes me gush. The other makes me nervous. I’m suspicious of voices that only tell me what I want to hear. \r&10;\r&10;Were it me, I might emphasize one thing, but not the other. I’d conceive of a God who is either never angry or never not angry. A soft, enabling God who doesn’t care enough to stop me from destroying myself, or a God so appalled at my relentless failure that he can’t bear to look at me without retching. But in Jesus, our soul-longings to be known and loved, for an end to evil and injustice are realized in the unfathomable beauty of truly self-sacrificial love.&quot; (Joshua S.

I prefer it because <em>not Amazon</em> and because it incorporates some data elements <strong>other than ratings</strong> which are useful for describing and finding books. I&rsquo;m hoping micro.blog&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves\">bookshelves</a> feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn&rsquo;t handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we&rsquo;ll see what the future holds.)</p>\n<p>I keep my to-read/wishlist as a <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd\">Bookshop list</a>, for ease of sharing and gift-giving.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-books\">The Books</h1>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the recommended ones, collected in <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/2022-recommendations-df1ac3a8-3069-4570-bcb2-9cfddd6c9504\">this Bookshop collection</a> or visually:</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>And here are <strong>all</strong> the books I read, individually, and in reading order (within rating):</p>\n<p>⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Six Deaths of the Saint (Into Shadow #3) - Alix E.

				"content_text": "Welcome to my yearly summary of books!\n\nTable of contents:\n\n- Intro - my process and tools\n- The Books - which books I recommend\n- Analysis - some introspection and goalsetting\n- Previously - links to prior years\n\n_Note: I will use Bookshop [affiliate links](/affiliate/) when available, throughout this post. You don't have to buy from my bookshop, but if you do, I put that money back into more books._\n\n# Intro\n\nI use and recommend [Libby](https://libbyapp.com/) for getting ebooks and audiobooks from the library. Most books I borrow digitally, but there are exceptions:\n\n* Books I plan to re-read\n* Deluxe or art-filled editions\n* Books I will use as a referenrce\n* Books I enjoyed and want to keep around\n\nFor those cases, I get physical editions via [Bookshop](https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis). And lest you think I don't really do physical books: my household has **15** brimming bookshelves.\n\nI take copious highlights and notes, and save them to Readwise. [Here's how.](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2022/04/09/being-wise-with.html) Highlights and notes are especially important for me with digital books, where spacial-temporal recollection is not as easy, but spaced-repitition and note-linking can make up for it (and then some). \n\nI track my reading in [The StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/toddgrotenhuis). I prefer it because _not Amazon_ and because it incorporates some data elements **other than ratings** which are useful for describing and finding books. I'm hoping micro.blog's [bookshelves](https://micro.blog/account/bookshelves) feature continues to improve, so that I could rely on book tracking directly in my blog, as well. (Today, it doesn't handle book search well nor let us use our own Bookshop links, but we'll see what the future holds.)\n\nI keep my to-read/wishlist as a [Bookshop list](https://bookshop.org/lists/wishlist-b2bcf0b3-374f-4c36-8016-f5f2acf47fbd), for ease of sharing and gift-giving.\n\n# The Books\n\nLet's start with the recommended ones, collected in [this Bookshop collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/2022-recommendations-df1ac3a8-3069-4570-bcb2-9cfddd6c9504) or visually: \n\n<img style=\"display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;\" src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2023/6295596f30.png\" alt=\"20222books\" title=\"20222books.png\" border=\"0\" width=\"568\" height=\"600\" />\n\nAnd here are **all** the books I read, individually, and in reading order (within rating): \n\n⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ :\n\n- The Six Deaths of the Saint (Into Shadow #3) - Alix E.

Which laws we want to see created and enforced tend to vary by political leanings.</p>\n<p>Between the FBI &amp; the police, the FBI is more likely to restrain the <strong>powerful</strong>, and the police are more likely to restrain the <strong>less-powerful</strong>. This aligns with the trends of the right and left wings in USAmerican politics. We should not see “surprise” with this alignment.</p>\n<p>Obviously there are <em>many exceptions</em>, and I am no proponent of either party (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/06/02/in-that-order.html\">nor in favor of “punching” in general</a>), but it is directionally true that he rightwing has been more likely to “punch down” towards those in weaker positions (e.g. immigration, poverty, sexuality, etc.) and the leftwing has been more likely to “punch up” towards those with power (e.g. monopoly, environment). <em>(All this despite the fact that people in powerful positions often feel like they are the embattled ones.)</em></p>\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: don’t be surprised that there are factions of the right wing calling to defund law enforcement that restrains the powerful.

				"content_text": "<p>This post is about how I make the best of <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">Readwise.io</a>, a service that works with your notes and highlights to enhance <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you don’t already use Readwise, I highly recommend it! <em>You and I both get a free month with my <a href=\"https://readwise.io/i/todd54\">affiliate code</a>.</em> As you can see, I use Readwise consistently:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/e37a135270.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"343\" /></p>\n<p>I will cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Getting Things In</strong>: making all your highlights and notes available</li>\n<li><strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>: tips for capture and organizing</li>\n<li><strong>Getting Things Out</strong>: making backups and data available in your notes system</li>\n<li><strong>Working with Ideas</strong>: making the most of your highlights and notes</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsin\">Getting Things In</h1>\n<p>My first principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Send Everything In</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, I want <em>all</em> my reading notes and highlights to end up in Readwise. I even want to supplement my notes and highlights with those that <em>others</em> are making! The system grows in value as more of your important items are included, both because of your ability to search the content and because of the network effects from different notes being available together. (We’ll explore this more in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>).</p>\n<p>Here are the steps:</p>\n<h2 id=\"1.connectallyourservices\">1. Connect All Your Services</h2>\n<p>Once you have an account, head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a> and turn on connections for any services you use.</p>\n<p>For me, that means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>all the places I read digital books (Kindle, Apple Books, Libby, and Kobo)</li>\n<li>all the places I read things other than books (Instapaper/Pocket, Twitter, Medium, Web Highlights, <a href=\"https://www.inoreader.com\">Inoreader</a>/<a href=\"https://feedly.com\">Feedly</a>, and the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> service from Readwise)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You might use other services and want to connect other them as well. Some additional examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.airr.io\">Airr</a> - podcasts</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.shortform.com\">Shortform</a> - book summaries</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<em>Side Note:</em> Some of the connectors might even inspire you to try a new service, so Readwise has started partnerships offering discounts on services.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"2.importotherhighlights\">2. Import Other Highlights</h2>\n<p>Not everything has a connector, yet. Even so, there is still probably an option to get those highlights and notes into Readwise. These options are also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p>For physical books, I use the mobile app (<a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/m88AXbvcygb\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"https://readwise.app.link/E0AsXt7lIgb\">Android</a>) and its OCR to import from my notes and highlights. Another alternative is the CSV or Email import option. I <em>always</em> add the location or page # field, because the structure and order of the highlights is often helpful later on (for context, etc.)</p>\n<p>There are other non-connector imports as well, such as pdfs, Scribd, O’Reilly, Google Play Books, and “my clippings” for direct files in your Kindle.</p>\n<p>You might even use the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/api_deets\">API</a> to meet your needs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Our API supports creating, fetching, and updating highlights on behalf of the user.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"3.getotherpeopleshighlights\">3. Get Other People’s Highlights</h2>\n<p>What if I finished a book a while ago and didn’t take highlights or notes? What if I listened to an audiobook? Maybe I just want to see other Readwise users’ highlights?</p>\n<p>In these cases, you can use the “Supplemental Books” feature, also found on the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/welcome/sync\">import page</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: if you connect Goodreads in <strong>Step 1</strong>, everything you finish in Goodreads will automatically get added as a supplemental book in Readwise.</p>\n<p>I do not use Goodreads anymore, so when I finish a non-fiction book where I didn’t take highlights or notes, I head over to the Supplemental Books tab and add the book. If no other Readwise user has made highlights, yet, I make a note in tasks to try again later.</p>\n<p>In later sections, we’ll talk more about how these supplemental books are part of the ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> some publishers lock down how much you can highlight and export from a book. This is not a Readwise problem, but it does affect Readwise. Just in case I run up against limits, I make a habit not to make really long highlights nor to over-highlight a book. These are generally good practices, anyway, as they limit your highlights to readable sections and just the really good stuff.</p>\n<h1 id=\"makinghighlightsandnotes\">Making Highlights and Notes</h1>\n<p>The second principle for Readwise is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Start Simple</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This section will includes tips for how to use more advanced highlighting and note-taking features, but you can <em>ignore it entirely</em> or start using the tips as they help you. You might have a finely-honed method that you don’t wan’t to disturb. <em>That’s fine</em>: start there. Come back here went you want to use new features or enhance your process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"organizing\">Organizing</h2>\n<p>When you’ve highlighted & annotated a long document or book, you’ll automatically have all those notes available to you, whether in the collection on the web, in daily review, or in your exports. But if you’re like me, you’d like to <strong>have a bit more structure</strong>, when you are looking at the overall document highlights.</p>\n<p>This is where <strong>headings</strong> come in.</p>\n<p>Headings allow you to structure your highlights at three different heading levels. A common pattern is to call out a <em>Part</em> as heading level 1, a <em>Chapter</em> as heading level 2, and a <em>Section</em> as heading level 3. Then, you’ll have a nice table-of-contents and structure for your notes.</p>\n<p>To use this organizational structure, add a note of “.h1”, “.h2”, or “.h3” to the highlight that you want to turn into a heading. The period before the “h” tells Readwise to treat your note as a tag, not your commentary, and it then processes the highlight as a heading instead of a normal highlight.</p>\n<p>Here’s an example from <em><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/07/05/finished-reading-lean.html\">Lean Software Development</a></em> where I used heading 1 for chapters and heading 2 for agile Tools and “Try This” activities.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/74241a09e2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"452\" /></p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: I generally avoid using heading 3. It is often too much. Make the choice based on your document and whether you’ll get value out of it.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: this is one area of Readwise that has some bugs remaining. Because the header tags get applied a special way, it’s important to enter the tags accurately and in order as you work through the document. I have some books where the heading structure is messed up and it’s not something you can fix fully in the web app. When this happens, you can delete and re-synch your book or document highlights, but this is a pain if you’ve already edited (with tags, commentary, etc.) the comments within Readwise, or already returned the digital book to the library. Hopefully this is something they are fixing in in the new <a href=\"https://readwise.io/read\">Reader</a> experience.</p>\n<p>Want to know more about headings? <a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/\">See their blog post on headings if you would like a more detailed explanation.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"tags\">Tags</h2>\n<p>You already learned about a special tag: headings. There’s another special tag: <strong>concatenation</strong>.</p>\n<p>Have you ever found a long chunk of text but really just want parts of it? Concatenation lets you highlight that way. Use “.c1”, “.c2”, “.c3” etc. notes to build a highlight that combines them. Readwise will show ellipses between the parts in the final highlight. (<a href=\"https://blog.readwise.io/combine-highlights-on-the-fly/\">Read their blog post about concatenation here</a>)</p>\n<p>Normal tags are created the same way as the special ones: while highlighting, add a “.” note, followed by how you’d like to tag the highlight. For example, I use “.i” for “inbox” and “.d” for “definition”. You don’t have to use shorthand, though! Your tag can be a word (or hyphenated words), but don’t add spaces or you’ll have just completed the tag and started making a normal note.</p>\n<p>Tags will be visible anywhere you are reviewing the tagged highlight, such as during daily review or when reviewing the document. From the web, you can also go to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tags</a> , see your tags, and see all the highlights with that tag.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> as with headings, I recommend you don’t go overboard here. It’s easy to waste a lot of time on tags you won’t use. It’s easy to add them later, so feel free to be sparing.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, you don’t know you want to tag something while you’re highlighting, but later you decide to in one of these situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you’re reviewing highlights from a document or your daily highlights</li>\n<li>a theme has started to emerge in your highlights</li>\n<li>you’re researching a topic within your notes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s fine! You can easily add tags during daily review (“T” if you like keyboard shortcuts) or when reviewing a document. I do a lot of each of those bullets above. I now use “mental-model”, “health”, “coaching”, “reflection”, “security”, “attention”, “resilient”, and “curious” heavily, but often <em>later, during review</em>.</p>\n<p>Final tip on tags: <strong>tag conversion.</strong></p>\n<p>Remember how I said I use “.d” for definition? Those actually show up in my tags as “definition”, because I converted (merged) the tag. From the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/tags\">tag view</a>, click the ellipses on a tag and rename, and all once-and-future uses of the old tag will become the become the new tag. So while reading I enter as “.d”, but I get “definition” in my highlights and notes. It’s a nice time-saving trick.</p>\n<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> I don’t know if there is a way to undo tag conversion. I don’t see one in the web interface. I’d suggest being double-sure before you go about this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"gettingthingsout\">Getting Things Out</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you’re now an expert at making good highlights, tags, and notes, right? But maybe you have a favorite notes system, or you’re worried about your data. For either (or both) reasons, you’ll want to sync your highlights outside of Readwise.</p>\n<p>The third principle for Readwise, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sync Your Data</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Head to the <a href=\"https://readwise.io/export\">export page</a>. There, connect your note-taking system(s) of choice, or wherever you’d like your highlights & notes to land. I have the following enabled for various reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evernote</li>\n<li>Obsidian</li>\n<li>Roam</li>\n</ul>\n<p>…but you can add others like Notion or RemNote.</p>\n<p><em>Note</em>: this is one of the other reasons you may not want to go overboard with tags. Once your notes are syncing into one of these systems, you may decide you want to tag within your note system instead of in Readwise. Before you make that call, make sure you understand how your system handles syncs from Readwise. I still use 10–15 tags when highlighting or in Readwise, and then use wiki-style links within my notes system to cross-reference certain topics. (More on that in <strong>Working with Ideas</strong>.)</p>\n<p>It’s also a good idea to backup any important data occasionally (and these highlights and notes are important, or you wouldn’t be making them!). The syncs you setup are a soft backup, but you can make a more direct one via the <em>CSV</em> or <em>Markdown</em> export, as well.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> you can also export just one document as markdown, when you need it. Head to <a href=\"https://readwise.io/everything\">browse</a> and from the dropdown on your document, choose “Export Highlights”.</p>\n<p><em>Another Note:</em> At this time, we cannot export highlights from <em>Supplemental Books</em>. You only get your own highlights. Bummer! There are probably some very good reasons for this, though, such as not getting junk into your notes that you didn’t vet first!</p>\n<h1 id=\"workingwithideas\">Working with Ideas</h1>\n<p>Ok, so you have a collection of highlights and annotations and it’s backed up and available in your notes. So what? It’s no good to you if you don’t do anything with it! With that in mind, I’ll share the ways that I get the most out of what I put in.</p>\n<h2 id=\"dailyreview\">Daily Review</h2>\n<p>Here’s my fourth principle for Readwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While you’re still building the habit, you can use this common habit-building rule, instead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Never Miss Twice in a Row</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Daily Review is the cornerstone of the value I receive from Readwise. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/configure/review\">Head over here to configure your review</a>.</p>\n<p>Here’s my basic setup:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sent every morning at 7</li>\n<li>Max out (15) highlights per day</li>\n<li>Blended old/new recency rate</li>\n<li>Bonus highlights <em>off</em> (I have other good recommendation sources)</li>\n<li>Quality filter <em>off</em> (I’d prefer to fix it)</li>\n<li>“Normal” frequency for books, articles, tweets</li>\n<li>Slightly-lower frequency for “supplemental books”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You, of course, can <strong>tune these settings to suit your needs</strong>. If you’re just building the review habit, you may want to start with fewer highlights, for example, to make it easier to build the habit.</p>\n<p>During the daily review, I’m doing a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increasing retention of key points</li>\n<li>Adding tags when I see themes emerging</li>\n<li>Cleaning up and annotating</li>\n<li>Getting inspiration</li>\n<li>Making the highlights “talk to each other”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Retention (#1) happens naturally through the process, but I accelerate it. When I come across a challenging highlight or something that caught me by surprise, I hit the feedback button and choose “soon” or “later” instead of the default “someday”. This means I’m going to see that highlight again sooner.</p>\n<p>And though my overall review frequencies are balanced, I do sometimes select the dropdown on a highlight and “show this doc more often” (or less often), to tune the amount of highlights I am seeing from a certain book or article.</p>\n<p>I mentioned adding tags (#2) in <strong>Making Highlights and Notes</strong>. This normally happens when I’m noticing topics that I’m highlighting frequently, or which are becoming a common topic in my reading or research. I am very interested in attention and focus, so I have started tagging items related to those topics. I also read things related to health and longevity, so I have started tagging items with actionable advice. I also have two themes that are very important to me: curiosity and resilience, so I have developed tags related to those. You will come up with your own themes!</p>\n<p>Cleaning up and annotating (#3) can be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>removing bad or no-longer-useful highlights (using the “discard” button)</li>\n<li>fixing highlight or note errors (it happens, especially if they are ones you put in by hand or OCR, see <strong>Getting Things In</strong>)</li>\n<li>making highlights <em>within</em> the highlights (use double underscores around the part you want to highlight)</li>\n<li>adding new commentary</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A common example would be when I don’t remember the context of a highlight, so I add a short note about what it means (perhaps after visiting the document highlights to see the surrounding highlights and structure).</p>\n<p><em>Tip</em>: Don’t feel bad about discarding highlights, especially from <em>Supplemental Books</em>, where they are someone else’s highlight. Discards don’t fully go away. Your discards go into a category named as such, and can be recovered. I’ve got 1276 discards!</p>\n<p>Regarding inspiration (#4), some highlights will make me want to start a blog post or put a task on my planner/calendar. Let your highlights provoke you!</p>\n<p>The last topic, highlight-collision (#5), is perhaps the most important, and is the reason why I max out my review to 15 highlights. I’m not just reviewing 15 highlights…I’m reviewing 15 highlights <strong>together</strong>. That means great chances for serendipity. Sometimes highlights will reinforce one another. Sometimes they will be in tension. Sometimes they will interact in such a way as to spark a new idea. These are magic moments. Dig in to what you are noticing. Add notes (either in the highlight or in your own system) about their interaction. Write a blog post. Make some art. Invent something. Run with it. <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Feel free to tell me what you learned or created.</a></p>\n<p>If you practice zettelkasten, evergreen notes, or a related system, this moment of <em>organized serendipity</em> is a good time to write connecting comments or notes. I use backlicks in Obsidian to accomplish this.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookreview\">Book Review</h2>\n<p>When I’ve completed a work of non-fiction (or even a work of fiction where I took more than a handful of highlights), I like to make sure all my notes are in order. I go back to the web view and check my structure (remember <strong>Headings</strong>?), my highlights, notes, and tags.</p>\n<p>This is a good way to refresh myself of everything in the book, and is a jumpstart on spaced-repetition/retention. I may add <em>Supplemental Highlights</em> if I want to see what others highlighted, too.</p>\n<p>This is also a good time to write a <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/books/\">book</a> review, even if it’s a short one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"playfavorites\">Play Favorites</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed during your daily review, or book review, that you can mark a highlight as a favorite. Go ahead, do it!</p>\n<p>Sunday <strong>Daily Review</strong> collections are special, and will contain only favorites. This is a good way to keep coming back to the highlights that are very meaningful for you. This leads us to…</p>\n<h2 id=\"showyourwork\">Show Your Work</h2>\n<p>You can also let people subscribe to an email with a sampling of your favorites, one or more collections of tags, some combination of these, or <em>all</em> your highlights. <a href=\"https://readwise.io/@toddgrotenhuis\">Mine is set to a weekly broadcast with a sampling from my personal favorites and reflection questions.</a></p>\n<p>But what I like even more than the subscription is the share button. When you are reviewing a highlight, hit the share arrow, and you’ll be presented with a few options to present an elegant version of your highlight, like this highlight I have tagged as “reflection”:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/48a152bac3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"336\" /></p>\n<p>I often share this way during the Sunday Favorites <strong>Daily Review</strong> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/sunday-quotes/\">like these</a>). I also find these shares to be a fun way to place a highlight into my notes, especially if I’m collecting a few highlights on a topic.</p>\n<p>Finally, if the notes system where you are highlighting your notes supports it, you can publish your highlights there, as well. <em>All of my highlights are currently public, via Obsidian.</em></p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>You’ve hopefully picked up four principles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>On input: <strong>Send Everything In</strong></li>\n<li>On highlighting: <strong>Start Simple</strong></li>\n<li>On output: <strong>Sync Your Data</strong></li>\n<li>On usage: <strong>Never Miss a Review</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope these will help you make the most of Readwise and help you with <strong>recall</strong>, <strong>reflection</strong>, <strong>inspiration</strong>, and <strong>creation</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This was already very long. Here are some advanced topics I didn’t cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Themed Reviews</li>\n<li>Flashcards</li>\n<li>Metadata</li>\n<li>Document Tags</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://read.readwise.io/\">Reader!</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact/\">Contact me</a> if you’d like to discuss any of these.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>As I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html\">2021 Product &amp; Service Recommendations</a>, I primarily use Plex + Plexamp for listening to music (and Marvis Pro on the go), and track listens in <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/user/screamsandreams\">Last.fm</a>. I listen to podcasts in Overcast.fm.</p>\n<p>I’ll cover a little bit about my listening habits, then share top albums and top podcasts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"musicoverview\">Music Overview</h1>\n<p>Here’s a rough map of my top genres over the year:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/ebef042eb8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"101\" /></p>\n<p>If none of those genres are of interest to you, you may just want to skip down to podcasts, otherwise you’re going to be scratching your head (or even recoiling) at a bunch of “weird music”.</p>\n<p>And here were the top 20 artists:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/98386352ce.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"167\" height=\"600\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to last.fm and <a href=\"https://deardestiny.shinyapps.io/tuneR/\">tuneR</a>, I can see that three bands were new to my top 20 this year: clipping., Silent Planet, and Joyhauser.</p>\n<p>I got tuned in to clipping. via a friend on Bandcamp, but as I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/31/recommendations-watching.html\">2021 Watching recommendations</a>, became a fan after watching their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk\">NPR (actually!) Tiny Desk Concert</a>. If you start to watch the video and are like “wait, I know him”, then you’re probably right. <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>Snowpiercer</em>, and <em>Central Park</em> are just a few of Daveed Diggs’s major credits.</p>\n<p>Silent Planet has been a fave of mine for a while, so I’m surprised this was the first time they broke the top 20. In addition to making great music, frontman Garrett Russell is a brilliant lyricist, delving passionately and intelligently into political and spiritual themes. (You may remember <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/24/syllabus-northernfires.html\">I’m slowly working on a readthrough of all the books referenced in just one of their tracks</a>.)</p>\n<p>Joyhauser is simply great thumping beats for when you need to focus or keep moving.</p>\n<h1 id=\"albums\">Albums</h1>\n<p>Unlike my other reviews, I restricted my specific album recommendations to ones that were released this year, so as to not have an overwhelming list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"onbandcamp\">On Bandcamp</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://aquilus.bandcamp.com/album/bellum-i\">Aquilus - Bellum I</a>: black metal, neo-folk</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://boysnoize.bandcamp.com/album/-\">Boys Noize - +/-</a>: techno, industrial</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/wriggle-expanded-2\">clipping. - Wriggle (Expanded)</a>: hip-hop, industrial hip-hop, horror</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://davequam.bandcamp.com/album/greasemania-vol-3\">Dave Quam - Greasemania Vol 3</a>: experimental, electronic</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://dawnofashesofficial.bandcamp.com/album/blood-of-the-titans-remixes\">Dawn of Ashes - Blood of Titans (Remixes)</a>: industrial, aggrotech</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://drumcorps.bandcamp.com/album/for-the-living\">Drumcorps - For the Living</a>: breakcore, experimental</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://faderhead.bandcamp.com/album/years-of-the-serpent\">Faderhead - Years of the Serpent</a>: industrial, ebm</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gelassenheit.bandcamp.com/album/gelassenheit\">Gelassenheit - Gelassenheit</a>: black metal, christian</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gelassenheit.bandcamp.com/album/don-thyself-in-the-armor-ov-god\">Gelassenheit - …Don Thyself in the Armor ov God</a>: black metal, christian</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hollywoodburns.bandcamp.com/album/the-age-of-the-saucers\">Hollywood Burns - The Age of Saucers</a>: soundtrack (to nothing), synth</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://heliocentricband.bandcamp.com/album/ishmael\">Heliocentric - Ishmael</a>: metalcore, djent</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keygenchurch.bandcamp.com/album/--2\">Keygen Church - ░█░█░░█░█░█░</a>: electronic, black metal</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://noiseunit.bandcamp.com/album/deviator\">Noise Unit - Deviator</a>: ebm</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://spiritboxofficial.bandcamp.com/album/eternal-blue\">Spiritbox - Eternal Blue</a>: metalcore, djent</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://kscopemusic.bandcamp.com/album/portals\">TesseracT - Portals</a>: progressive metal, prog rock</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thou.bandcamp.com/album/hightower\">Thou - Hightower</a>: sludge, doom</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://violence-project.bandcamp.com/album/opus-i\">Violence - Opus I</a>: industrial, metal, crossover</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://virtualterrorist.bandcamp.com/album/gutter-mixes-vol-2\">Virtual Terrorist - Gutter Mixes Vol 2</a>: industrial, noise</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"honorablementionsthatarenotonbandcampboo\">Honorable Mentions that are not on Bandcamp (boo!)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Between the Buried and Me - Colors II: progressive metal, jazz metal\n<ul>\n<li><em>Note: some of their music <a href=\"https://btbam.bandcamp.com/music\">is on bandcamp</a>, but not this album, yet.

It feels like a (modern) history lesson every time, too. Warning: every episode of this show seems to end on a melancholy note, literally and figuratively.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80227090\">I Am Mother</a> - I’d love to discuss this sci-fi suspense!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1\">The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</a> Season 1 - This felt like the most “comic book” of the MCU so far, due to the everybody having to fight everybody, etc. Great preaching from Sam at the end of the season.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venom_(2018_film)\">Venom</a> - utterly ridiculous and a lot of fun</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/movies/blade\">Blade</a> - rewatched this; interesting to hear Blade will be coming into the MCU</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Planet\">Fantastic Planet</a> - totally original french animated scifi from 1973</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/mr-show\">Mr. Show</a> Seasons 1–3 - some of this didn’t age well, but I love sketch comedy and their take on the Python-esque surreal sketch transitions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.tenetfilm.com/?cinematic\">Tenet</a> - this was an instant purchase</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00yzlr0\">Line of Duty</a> Season 1 - What a wild ride! I had to space these out because they were so provocative, complex, and intense. Season 2 <em>not</em> recommended.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show\">A Black Lady Sketch Show</a> Season 2 - Not as good as season 1, but still good sketch comedy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80174608\">Love, Death &amp; Robots</a> Season 2 - Not as mind-altering as Season 1, but still full of incredible experiments</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self/less\">Self/less</a> - Good, interesting. Would have been even better with more of a Christopher Nolan treatment and less of a Product Placement treatment.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU\">Welcome to the Internet</a> - “could I interest you in everything all of the time?“ Lots of good critique in this hilarious self-produced music video. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483\">Full special here.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primal_Fear_(film)\">Primal Fear</a> - Very late to the party on this one. Surprised I didn’t see this back when it came out, as it was definitely my kind of movie. A little dated and a little predictable, but still very enjoyable and worth a discussion.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fn6S9NTpPvk\">Tiny Desk Concert: clipping.</a> - this is the first <em>actual</em> tiny desk concert, and the start of my obsession with clipping. (Stay tuned for Listening Recommendations)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thesuicidesquad.net\">The Suicide Squad</a> - Ludicrous, gory, and hilarious. I’m not much of a DC guy, but this was some wicked fun.</li>\n<li>🎶 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKtEJ9-GVoE\">Marc Rebillet and Madison McFerrin</a> - incredible looping and improv chemistry</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81122572\">Middleditch &amp; Schwartz</a> - long-form improv comedy</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy\">Ted Lasso</a> Season 2 - not as good as season 1, but still challenging, human, and funny</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(TV_series)\">Foundation</a> Season 1 - Unnecessarily brutal at at times (<em>and I mean the storytelling, not the content…some details don’t need to be on the screen</em>), but otherwise very good</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://movies.disney.com/soul\">Soul</a> - Heartbreaking at times, but a beautiful movie</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further Reading:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/12/30/recommendations-products-and.html\">2021 Recommended Products &amp; Services</a> (incl. those related to watching)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/142837.html\">See last year’s writeup here.</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Security and engineering teams are scrambling to protect against attacks. The best teams started last week or weekend, but many organizations waited until Monday or later to get going. The vulnerability is once again hitting the hard problems of inventory management, 3rd-party software component management, and vendor management. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen something this bad in 20 years of being a security practitioner. The vulnerability is easy to exploit, has the worst kind of impact (it runs the attacker&rsquo;s code), and is present in many common technologies. In addition, there have been several follow-on problems identified, such as additional attacks, or weaknesses in the fixes for the attack! If you&rsquo;d like a laugh instead of cry, check <a href=\"https://log4jmemes.com\">log4j memes</a>.</p>\n<p>⚽️ After a really great start to the Premiere League (where they were recently top of the table) and Champions League (where they are reigning champions), <a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en\">Chelsea</a> are leaking goals and struggling at this point in the seasons. 3-3 vs. Zenit in the CL means they take 2nd spot (below Juventus), but are on to the round of 16 and matched up with Lille. They got a little lucky in the Leeds PL game to win 3-2, but tied 1-1 in what should have been an easy win at home against Everton.</p>\n<p>🛩 I recently had my 2nd business travel since &ldquo;the beforetimes&rdquo;. I tested when I got back and am luckily safe. I welcomed my new team members (direct and indirect reports) and honed 2022 strategy with the leaders on my team. It was good getting people together, but still feels a little strange getting back to it! In other work news, I also got the promotion I had been hoping for, bringing me to only 1 to 2 levels below my internal customers and working peers 😆. (Outside my team, I primarily work with SVPs and VPs, and am now an AVP.) Joking aside, I am thankful for the support of my leaders, who have shown trust in me and helped find funding and assistance for the important initiatives I&rsquo;ve been pushing.</p>\n<p>📚 My spouse and I registered for a new library. To be honest, we mostly did it to have another library in <a href=\"https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/\">Libby/Overdive</a>, but it turns out the library is lovely, too. There&rsquo;s no public funding in the town for a library and kids had to pay high fees to get access to a library in one of the neighboring towns. So, one family donated the land, funds for the building, and funds for the initial collection of materials. The library stays afloat with donations and a modest yearly fee for patrons. We were charmed by the library, especially their themed puzzle 🧩 collection that you can borrow like books!</p>\n<p>🌟🎄 I&rsquo;m looking forward to a break, soon. We&rsquo;ll be hosting my spouse&rsquo;s side of the family, again. All (who can be) are vaccinated (and boosted) and we will be testing before we get together. We have folks with compromised immune systems and/or who are too young to be vaccinated, but we are being safe for each other. We&rsquo;re very much looking forward to time together, as there has been so little of that in the last two years.</p>\n",

In addition, there have been several follow-on problems identified, such as additional attacks, or weaknesses in the fixes for the attack! If you'd like a laugh instead of cry, check [log4j memes](https://log4jmemes.com).\n\n⚽️ After a really great start to the Premiere League (where they were recently top of the table) and Champions League (where they are reigning champions), [Chelsea](https://www.chelseafc.com/en) are leaking goals and struggling at this point in the seasons. 3-3 vs. Zenit in the CL means they take 2nd spot (below Juventus), but are on to the round of 16 and matched up with Lille. They got a little lucky in the Leeds PL game to win 3-2, but tied 1-1 in what should have been an easy win at home against Everton.\n\n🛩 I recently had my 2nd business travel since \"the beforetimes\". I tested when I got back and am luckily safe. I welcomed my new team members (direct and indirect reports) and honed 2022 strategy with the leaders on my team. It was good getting people together, but still feels a little strange getting back to it! In other work news, I also got the promotion I had been hoping for, bringing me to only 1 to 2 levels below my internal customers and working peers 😆. (Outside my team, I primarily work with SVPs and VPs, and am now an AVP.) Joking aside, I am thankful for the support of my leaders, who have shown trust in me and helped find funding and assistance for the important initiatives I've been pushing. \n\n📚 My spouse and I registered for a new library. To be honest, we mostly did it to have another library in [Libby/Overdive](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/), but it turns out the library is lovely, too. There's no public funding in the town for a library and kids had to pay high fees to get access to a library in one of the neighboring towns. So, one family donated the land, funds for the building, and funds for the initial collection of materials. The library stays afloat with donations and a modest yearly fee for patrons. We were charmed by the library, especially their themed puzzle 🧩 collection that you can borrow like books!\n\n🌟🎄 I'm looking forward to a break, soon. We'll be hosting my spouse's side of the family, again. All (who can be) are vaccinated (and boosted) and we will be testing before we get together. We have folks with compromised immune systems and/or who are too young to be vaccinated, but we are being safe for each other. We're very much looking forward to time together, as there has been so little of that in the last two years.\n",

I abstain from ad-supported and/or algorithmically manipulated social media.<br /><br />2. I avoid websites with an endless scroll. Aka “doomscrolling.”<br /><br />3. The only notifications I allow on my phone are calendar appointments.<br /><br />4. I use privacy-respecting hardware and software, when they exist. When they don’t, I make do with the next best thing. (I’m looking at you, Apple!)<br /><br />5. I minimize opinion-checking. That is, I form my own conclusions rather than caring what “the internet thinks” about a topic.<br /><br />6. I don’t frequent places where assholes thrive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

We had some fun ones like:<br /><br /></div>\n<ul>\n<li>\"shortcuts\": if you get somebody out ahead of you, you can go straight to their position instead of the normal rotation</li>\n<li>\"spikes\": you can reach over/across into somebody else's square for your hit</li>\n<li><em>must</em> hit twice</li>\n<li>keep it going: you have to try to hit it if it's going out</li>\n<li>use a fist: must use bumps/punches, not sets, etc.</li>\n<li>dance: you have to do a dance after you get somebody out or instead <em>you</em> are out</li>\n<li>equipment is lava: if you touch the bars, etc. you are out</li>\n<li>lowered: towards the end, we started moving the height down</li>\n<li>permanent out: we ended with this as our last rule, to bring it down to find the final champion</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br />One common collection of rules started to become our default.

As I’m now in my second month of <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/06/30/what-i-learned.html\">using a continuous glucose monitor</a>, and having conducted some self-experiments, I can see the effects of the above quote in my own body.<br /><br />For example: I participated in a coke challenge, where we had a coke after fasting compared to a coke after fasting <em>followed by walking for half an hour or more</em>. Walking improved my glucose response by 5 points on a 10-point scale (from a 2 to a 7). Here’s another way they say it in the podcast episode notes:</div>\n</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><img title=\"AMA #20_ Simplifying the complexities of insulin resistance_ how it's measured, how it manifests in the muscle and liver, and what we can do about it.png\" src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2021/f82ecd38ca.png\" alt=\"AMA  20 Simplifying the complexities of insulin resistance how it s measured how it manifests in the muscle and liver and what we can do about it\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"0\" /></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div class=\"trix-content\">\n<div>I’m continuing to work with a trainer a couple times a week, doing a fun activity at least once a week, and am moving (walking, hiking, biking, etc.) almost every day. I <em>particularly </em>get moving after having a meal that would be a bit higher in carbs. It makes a significant difference on my results.<br /><br />To explain “to your tolerance”: we are all different in our hormonal setup (insulin, cortisol) as well as our muscle mass/distribution, both of which are major deciders of how much our body will burn glucose (and use glycogen) versus store it as fat (as triglycerides in adipose tissue).<br /><br />So their point there is that if we are getting good exercise, good muscle but not getting good metabolic results, then we also can limit simple carbs (especially fructose, which has particular effects beyond glucose) to get to where we want to be.<br /><br />This is really promising for preventing or reversing the issues listed, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and other metabolic disorders.<br /><br />—<br /><br />Tagged: <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/LZW0VVmGykLNYG\">Resilient -&gt; Self</a></div>\n<div> </div>\n</div>\n",

				"title": "What I learned during my first week with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM)",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>About a week ago, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/06/22/got-started-with.html\">I got started with a continuous glucose monitor</a>. &quot;Glucose monitor&quot; means it's a device that records and reports blood sugar. &quot;Continuous&quot; means it is collecting data throughout the day and night.<br> <br>You might be wondering:<br><br></div><blockquote><em>Why? Are you diabetic or pre-diabetic? </em></blockquote><div><br>No, thankfully I am not!<br><br>However, data is growing showing a link between metabolic health and many major diseases, from the more well-known links like heart disease to the lesser-obvious ones like dementia and certain types of cancer. I want to reduce my risk for these chronic diseases and also increase my likelihood of being able to continue the types of activities that I enjoy. This is one part of broader habits meant to benefit my health (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/5VEculvEDoTT8x\">good sleep habits</a>, healthy eating, mental &amp; physical exercise, stress management, etc.).<br><br></div><blockquote><em>But can't you just eat keto or vegan or whatever my preferred diet is?</em></blockquote><div><em> </em></div><div>Turns out there can be great difference in people's genetics and biomes, leading to different responses to different foods. I have some simple eating habits that help me a great deal, but one reason I'm doing this is to see what is healthiest <em>for me</em>.<br><br></div><h1>About the CGM:</h1><div>I acquired my CGM through <a href=\"https://www.levelshealth.com/join?partner=RZUESFCY\">Levels</a>, as part of their beta. They do not manufacture the CGM device, but instead make an app and service that works with the CGM data.<br>The CGM is applied to the upper arm and stays there for up to 14 days. It's held on by an adhesive patch. While there, it records and holds up 8 hours worth of data. A mobile phone is held up to the CGM to pull in the data to the CGM manufacturer's default app.<br> Levels has developed an additional app and service that enhances the base data from the CGM manufacturer. It links with Apple Health data and the CGM app data to perform enhanced reporting.<br> The Levels app takes my notes about food/drink, exercise, or other events (like stressors) and uses these data points to score those actions by looking at the blood sugar for the 2 hours following the activity (they call this a &quot;zone&quot;). Zones are scored 1-10 based on blood sugar response. Days also get a rating of 1-100, and then daily, weekly, (and it looks like) monthly reports are provided. <br><br>The three main scoring factors Levels uses are:<br><br></div><ul><li>Glucose Variability (lower scores better)</li><li>Average Glucose (lower scores better)</li><li>Time in Target (higher is better, with &quot;target&quot; being 70-110 mg/dL)</li></ul><div><br>The app also builds a catalog of zone scores so that I start to get a profile of healthier activities (10/9/8) and less healthy ones, based on my unique metabolism. It also offers &quot;challenges&quot; of things to try different ways to see what my scores will be, to help me make informed decisions.</div><div><br></div><h1>What I've Learned:</h1><ul><li><strong><em>Mornings must start right</em></strong><strong>: </strong>I see that my days often start on my higher end for blood sugar. In addition, if I have carbs in the morning, it is easier to spike. Prevailing wisdom about this is that our bodies are ramping up cortisol in the morning as we prep for the day (and perhaps start experiencing stressors). One of my friends who is a doctor said this cortisol response is why many heart attacks happen in the early morning! What I've learned is I should skip breakfast, have a very-low (or no-carb) breakfast, or have a mild workout and then have a light-carb breakfast.</li><li><strong><em>Exercise makes even more difference than I thought: </em></strong>I already knew <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/wTiEurDggfjFE3\">that taking a walk after a meal</a> is helpful, but I didn't realize <em>just how much</em>. I had a pretty terrible dinner one night (pizza, sport drink, cake, ice cream), and some fun exercise before and afterwards, and my blood sugar wasn't too bad! Conversely (see bullet #1), I've had morning meals that registered as really bad (a #3 score), even when they didn't include sweets.</li><li><strong><em>Order of operations - not just for math:</em></strong> what order I have my meal in makes a difference. Putting the fiber, fat, and protein at the front of a meal leads to better results than having bread, etc. up front. If there's something a little bad in the meal, having it last really does help. This is likely because the absorption rate of carbs is slowed down by the fiber, fat, and protein.</li><li><strong><em>Ice cream isn't so bad: </em></strong>Likely a corollary of the above bullet, ice cream doesn't affect my blood sugar too much. This may be my best option when having an occasional treat.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>I'm looking to see what I learn about more food, exercise, and stressor events in the coming weeks. Which food pairings work for me and which do not? Does meditation counteract stressors sufficiently? Do I do ok with sweet potatoes? Bananas? Rice? Much more to learn!<br><br>---<br>Have you used a CGM? Do you have questions for me or ideas for experiments? I'd love to <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">hear from you</a>.</div>\n</div>\n",

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>Longer quote:<br><br></div><blockquote>During the years of the Iraq War and during the 2008 election, Christian blogs spent a lot of time writing about Constantinianism in voicing their opposition to the war in Iraq. Christian blogs were very Anabaptist during the golden era of blogging. Not so much anymore.<br><br>Why the change? <br><br>My argument, made in 2016, is that the post-evangelical Christians who inveighed again Constantinianism during the Bush years weren't really Anabaptists. They were, rather, Christian realists in the tradition of Reinhold Niebuhr. That is to say, progressive Christians, as witnessed in the 2008 election of Barack Obama, actually <em>wanted</em> and <em>desired</em> to win and weld the power of the nation state. You saw this hypocrisy in how post-evangelical bloggers hammered Bush with Constantine but said nary a word about Obama's drone war. Turns out, it's okay to pull the trigger when it's your guy holding the gun. And we saw again the thirst to win back and weld power among progressive Christians in the election of 2020. <br><br>All that to say, it's hard to decry Constantinianism when you're trying your damnedest to win every election. </blockquote><div><br>This is from the <a href=\"http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/06/will-real-christianity-please-stand-up.html\">second post</a> in a new Experimental Theology series called &quot;<a href=\"http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/2021/05/will-real-christianity-please-stand-up.html\">Will the Real Christianity Please Stand Up</a>&quot;.<br><br>Now, as one of those folks who started blogging in the early 2000s, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/01/28/yr-mennonite.html\"><em>became</em></a> Anabaptist during that &quot;golden era&quot;, and then <em>maintained</em> that anabaptist perspective, this whole post (ugly parts and all) rings true to me. <br><br>Richard Beck's key blog series have become some of my favorite books: <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781608992423\"><em>Unclean</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781620327777\"><em>The Slavery of Death</em></a><em>, </em>and many more. I'm very interested to see where this series will go, and how Beck will deal with the &quot;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman\">No True Scotsman</a>&quot; problem in the analysis.<br><br>---<br>Thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Let me know!</a></div>\n</div>\n",

I grew up in a wealthy country, didn't experience serious health conditions, and have not had to worry about if I would be able to find my next meal. I had access to good education. I haven't been harassed, harmed, or neglected due to the color of my skin. And most importantly <em>for this topic</em>, I grew up in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom\">Christendom</a>, a part of the world where Christian belief has been a dominant force in public opinion and even in governance.<br><br> It's in these areas of Christendom where I am surprised (and frankly, embarrassed) when Christians talk about being \"persecuted\". Christians in Christendom often read Bible stories and see themselves in the narratives as the Israelites enslaved in Egypt, or the early Christians under Rome. But what we must realize is we are more likely to be on the side of Pharaoh, Herod, or Caesar.<br><br>When you dig into it what \"persecution\" these Christendom-Christians are facing, it usually ends up being one of two things:<br><br></div><ul><li>Social consequences for conservative ideology and/or for bigotry</li><li>An underlying fear that we are moving into a post-Christendom world</li></ul><div><br>Neither of these are persecution. Let's talk about them in order.<br><br></div><h1>Social Consequences</h1><div>To understand this one, we need to step back a bit.<br><br>One of the problems with Christendom is that Christianity syncretizes with the government, with the dominant political beliefs, the dominant economic order, and/or with nationalism. Christians begin to conflate being part of a party, ideology, or nation with being a Christian. We can end up working as hard (or harder) for those beliefs than we do trying to follow the Lamb.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--png\">\n      <a download=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" title=\"Download The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_378387804\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUIya0NBQVU2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwU3pvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--9333ff4f088aa9239bed4b0a224e37f2c7bab42d/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png\" alt=\"The Naked Anabaptist (1).png\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFJQUQya0NBQW82REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUVRvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--435325a84611f9b4e2210760d04bed2a88c1f429/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 2x, https://world.hey.com/toddg/c5a80848/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCRnk5alJZPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--eb6b39b2382c8f9c7990f1962da363b90e6eb2ce/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lJY0c1bkJqb0dSVlE2RkhKbGMybDZaVjkwYjE5c2FXMXBkRnNIYVFLQUZta0NBQTg2REhGMVlXeHBkSGxwUERvTGJHOWhaR1Z5ZXdZNkNYQmhaMlV3T2cxamIyRnNaWE5qWlZRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--c01f3983c1786fbe1f418ce337eaa6c9bbc6125e/The%20Naked%20Anabaptist%20(1).png 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure></div><div><br>Specifically, far too many Christians in Christendom have an unhealthy (and frankly, heretical) confusion of social conservatism and Christianity. They attempt to wield the power & violence of the state to control non-Christians' personal beliefs and actions, most egregiously and notably in issues of sexuality. This isn't the gospel, and it's not behaving like the one they proclaim to follow (<a href=\"https://netbible.org/bible/Luke+4\"><em>who specifically refused power-over temptations when Satan put them to him!</em></a>). And when people react to this controlling (and often bigoted) behavior with condemnation, social sanctions, or defensive legislation, it's not \"persecuting\" the Christian. The Christian was the aggressor, here.</div><div><br></div><h1>Post-Christendom</h1><div>It's true, many parts of the world are on the move from Christendom to post-Christendom. (<em>Note: this is partly due to Christians acting as pretty terrible representatives of the good news, as I alluded to earlier...but that's a whole other post</em>). In Post-Christendom, Christianity has a waning influence on public opinion and governance, as a plurality of voices emerges or a new perspective becomes most common.<br><br>This is unsettling for Christians who enjoyed (whether they realized it or not) being in the seats of prestige and power. But as the saying goes, <em>\"</em><strong><em>When You're Accustomed to Privilege, Equality Feels Like Oppression</em></strong><em>\" </em>In other words, losing privilege is not the same thing as being persecuted. <em><br></em><br></div><h1>Ok, But What About Real Persecution?</h1><div>If a Christian should suffer real persecution, the gospels and epistles offer us instructions and hope:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Mat 5:44</strong> But I say to you, love your enemy and pray for those who persecute you</li><li><strong>Rom 12:14</strong> Bless those who persecute you, bless and do not curse.</li><li><strong>1Co 4:12</strong> When we are verbally abused, we respond with a blessing, when persecuted, we endure</li><li><strong>Heb 10:33</strong> At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way.</li><li><strong>2Co 4:9</strong> we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed</li><li><strong>Gal 1:23</strong> They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.”</li><li>...and many more</li></ul><div><br>Jesus and early followers of the Way were very clear about not returning evil for evil. In fact, the church has often grown the most in places and times of persecution!<br><br>While we don't desire persecution, the duty of a Christian is to follow <a href=\"https://cpt.org/files/BN%20-%20Jesus'%20Third%20Way.pdf\">the third way</a> when encountering it, to bear witness to shared humanity, to goodness, and to a God who loves all people.<br><br>---<br>Have thoughts? <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">Here's how to respond.</a></div>\n</div>\n",

It's the follow-up to the great <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781942788294\">Phoenix Project</a>. As I said in my <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2021/01/02/nonfiction-review.html\">2021 book review</a>:<br><br></div><blockquote>&quot;what Kim did for Ops &amp; DevOps in the Phoenix project, he has continued for product development in this work&quot;</blockquote><div><br>Both of these books use narrative to demonstrate the move to agile ways of working and devops transformations within an auto-parts selling business.<br><br>These five ideals are very helpful for looking at ways to enhance a technology practice.<br><br>---<br><br>Here's where I'm going to &quot;think out loud&quot; again. As I read these, I realized they'd make a better framing for how I've been approaching some challenges my team faces at work. I've been communicating with my manager using the perspective of &quot;accountability without authority or responsibility&quot;, and while that's true, the <em>Unicorn Project</em> ideals might be an even better lens by which to view the problems.<br><br>Let me work through them to see what we are doing or could do in each area.<br><br></div><h1>Locality and Simplicity</h1><div>This is the core issue, as I've recently been thinking about it. My team relies on data, processes, instructions, and approval for almost everything from another team (and primarily one team). Work comes in from the other team, work goes back to that team. This disincentivizes problem ownership by either team, as things get &quot;tossed over the wall&quot;. Further, because of the back and forth, there are steps that don't necessarily add value.<br><br>To solve these, we need to create local ownership and reduce waste &amp; complexity. Instead of there-&gt;here-&gt;there work, we can improve this in one of the following ways:<br><br></div><ul><li>here-&gt;here-&gt;there: meaning that my team sets the direction, rather than receiving it, but the other team still manages the result</li><li>there-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that my team still receives the direction, but has more capability to finish the work on their own</li><li>there-&gt;there-&gt;there or here-&gt;here-&gt;here: meaning that one team has full ownership for direction, results, and problems for an area of work</li></ul><div><br></div><div>For us, the most appropriate short term answer is here-&gt;here-&gt;there, with a potential move eventually to a true locality where one team manages something all the way through the lifecycle. I've been advocating for this two-step approach, but now have a different way to talk about it.<br><br></div><h1>Focus, Flow, and Joy</h1><div>We have a culture of meetings. This is especially true for our New York office (where my boss and my peers are originally from). During covidtide, this has ramped up even further. Added to that, my team is working with a great number of stakeholders (often working with with many leaders and over 250 internal customers, each), has many sources of incoming requests, and encounters many &quot;squirrels&quot; caused by hot topics or VIP perspectives.<br><br>Altogether, those equate to very little time for focus or deep work. That results in less satisfaction and joy as people feel like they are constantly juggling instead of achieving momentum through wins.<br><br>We've got a few irons in the fire on this, too:<br><br></div><ul><li>&quot;No Meeting Wednesdays&quot;: we instituted this recently, and while not perfect (due to stakeholder meetings and increased interruptions from people who know we are &quot;free&quot;), it helps there be the chance for blocks of time for focus</li><li>&quot;Ways of Working&quot; agile alignment: I've been proposing that we get all our work visible under one mechanism, so that we can better manage priority, work-in-progress, etc. It would also help to have requests come in a common way, reducing interruptions. We've got buy-in now to get some agile coaches working with our broader org on a group transformation.</li><li>Using collaborative tools: Many interruptions can go away if we have standard means to keep one another up-to-date or make decisions. I'm helping push adoption of these ways. (Kanban boards instead of status meetings and inquiries, asynchronous work out of the same document rather than a meeting for committee-editing, decision-records and next-actions captured in writing, etc.)</li></ul><div><br></div><h1>Improvement of Daily Work</h1><div>There isn't a lot additional to say here, as so much of it is dependent on the above two areas. If my team doesn't have much ownership of their work, nor the time to focus on changes, it's very difficult to focus on daily improvements.<br><br>Instead, I try to make up for some of this deficit by spending a lot of <strong><em>my time</em></strong> on this, looking for ways to help the team. Creating clarity. Creating or sharing resources that make things easier. Promoting the internal sharing of best practices, wins, and lessons-learned. Cutting waste. Eliminating blockers. Etc.<br><br></div><h1>Psychological Safety</h1><div>The idea of psychological safety is this: Team members have to feel that it's ok to speak up, that their concerns won't be dismissed and they won't be retaliated against. Team members have to feel that it's ok to learn, make mistakes, clean up after themselves, and grow; that they won't be penalized for trying something new. <br><br>It wouldn't be appropriate to say much here (as it could affect psychological safety!), but I will say that I seek to promote psychological safety by being transparent, authentic, and non-defensive. I look to give opportunities for people to stretch themselves in a safe manner. I aim to make sensitive constructive comments in private and heap praise in public. <br><br></div><h1>Customer Focus</h1><div>We can think about customer focus in two ways.<br><br>The first is the most important: the <em>end</em> costumer of the product or service. Do we know what they need, and is our work ultimately serving them? Or are we creating waste and doing pet projects?<br><br>The second is the <em>internal</em> customer, or stakeholder. This one is easy to overlook, especially if a team isn't used to thinking about <em>having</em> customers, which is an all-too-common occurrence in the technology world. <br><br>To help with this, what I do is to advocate for customer and stakeholder perspectives up front and every step along the way, both in my team and for the teams where <em>we</em> are the internal customer.<br><br></div><ul><li>Who will use the product or service?</li><li>What do they need?</li><li>How does that inform our requirements?</li><li>Is somebody getting their perspective and feedback?</li><li>Do you need to get their buy-in for the solution?</li><li>Is there an easy way for them to give you feedback and see that you are doing something about it?</li><li>etc.</li></ul><div><br>If your org has a product-owner type role, this helps a great deal!</div><div><br></div><div>---<br><br>I hope taking a look at these 5 ideals was helpful for you.

Robinson ⭐️⭐️⭐️<br><br>Here's the summary from <a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/RDESD4N2UufTO2\">my public notes</a>:<br><br></div><blockquote>Extractive political institutions and extractive economic institutions create a reinforcing vicious cycle. “Extractive” institutions are ones where the power and wealth are funneled towards a controlling group.<br><br>Conversely, inclusive political and economic institutions create a virtuous reinforcing cycle. &quot;Inclusive” institutions are ones that have pluralistic power and rule of law.<br><br>Inclusive institutions support longer-term planning, because people can rely on rights &amp; protection, and thus save and invest in education &amp; innovation.<br> <br>These ideas are, at their core, basic classically-liberal principles.<br> <br>The authors have done a good job of showing how inclusive institutions lead to growing nations, and how extractive institutions can lead to capture, authoritarian regimes, or societal collapse.<br> <br>What the authors have not made a case for is why growth is the most important means of measurement, nor why centralization of power is required for inclusivity. (One can imagine decentralized systems that protect rights and rule of law, for example). Nor have the authors deeply examined resource/environmental extraction and what that will mean for the future of all institutions, should our approach to natural resources not shift to an inclusive model.</blockquote><div><br>Have you read this book or one of the others that talk about why nations rise and fall?

I figured our neighborhood runoffs and creeks would be in rare form, as they tend to be after some good rains. So, I got my rain jacket, my &quot;amphibious&quot; sandals, left my phone at home, and headed off for a splash.<br><br>First fun thing I saw today was a pair of ducks that seemed understandably wary of me, but otherwise seemed to be loving the weather.<br><br>Next, I noticed somebody has been planting (grafting, maybe?) heritage raspberries along the back side of one of the runoff creeks. I couldn't identify them at this stage, but they were labeled and had stakes to help them grow. I fixed one that had lost its support. I don't know how safe those will be for human consumption due to the runoff from parking lots (if you have thoughts, <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/contact\">please share</a>!) but they should be a nice addition at least for the animal life.<br><br>I couldn't navigate everywhere I wanted, due to the depth and speed of the water, but I had a lot of fun. This reminds me that I'd like to get some nice waders. (Any recommendations?)<br><br>On the way back, I startled a rabbit. We spent some time watching each other, and it was good. The bun was a little wet from the rain but still fluffed up, finding shelter under a neighbor's trailer, and looking warm.<br><br>I love these little local jaunts, and hope someday to have a place where the jaunts are even better.<br><br>  <figure class=\"attachment attachment--preview attachment--lightboxable attachment--jpg\">\n      <a download=\"IMG_0546.JPG\" title=\"Download IMG_0546.JPG\" data-click-proxy-target=\"lightbox_link_blob_351974657\" href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/0ab7f14d/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQUcxK2hRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e20ce23c277e39d4f38798f7f0753c81ac7190c1/IMG_0546.JPG?disposition=attachment\">\n        <img src=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/0ab7f14d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQUcxK2hRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e20ce23c277e39d4f38798f7f0753c81ac7190c1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ2dBZHBBZ0FGT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVVzNkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--f471c1ffaca66cc4364975d0d9779c7aba85da3a/IMG_0546.JPG\" alt=\"IMG_0546.JPG\" srcset=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/0ab7f14d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQUcxK2hRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e20ce23c277e39d4f38798f7f0753c81ac7190c1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ0FBOXBBZ0FLT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVVFNkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--3a7e78eb8ed42e3a1c04a9c19016e60d57ada844/IMG_0546.JPG 2x, https://world.hey.com/toddg/0ab7f14d/representations/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCQUcxK2hRPSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--e20ce23c277e39d4f38798f7f0753c81ac7190c1/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDam9MWm05eWJXRjBTU0lKYW5CbFp3WTZCa1ZVT2hSeVpYTnBlbVZmZEc5ZmJHbHRhWFJiQjJrQ2dCWnBBZ0FQT2d4eGRXRnNhWFI1YVR3NkMyeHZZV1JsY25zR09nbHdZV2RsTURvTlkyOWhiR1Z6WTJWVSIsImV4cCI6bnVsbCwicHVyIjoidmFyaWF0aW9uIn19--0dd9d5933b523ce7ef66e52859226a476018d079/IMG_0546.JPG 3x\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</a>\n  </figure><br><br>Happy spring to you!</div><div>---<br>-<a href=\"https://todd.grotenhuis.info/\">Todd</a></div>\n</div>\n<br><hr><i>Originally posted at <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/saturday-creek-stomping-0ab7f14d\">Hey World</a></i>\n",

				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>A little while back, I was having a conversation with my company’s CTO. We were discussing what engineering behaviors we wanted to encourage to continue to promote trust and safety.<br><br></div><blockquote><em>How do we build in helpful behaviors? How do we make doing the right thing easy? How do we make things repeatable, scalable, and resilient? How do we spend our time on the most valuable things?</em></blockquote><div><br>There are, of course, multiple interesting answers to these questions and many things our teams are doing to excel in these areas. But one of the things that came out of this discussion was that our CTO was having engineering leaders go back and read the (now classic) book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/lean-software-development-an-agile-toolkit/9780321150783\"><em>Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit</em></a> by Mary and Tom Poppendiek.<br><br>So, I decided to do the same, and I also planned to share the lessons with my direct team (of Business Information Security Officers) and the broader team of Risk &amp; Security. One of the BISOs on my team (who has also read the book) has also volunteered to work with me on materials. We’ve got a great partner, too, who will help us turn the lessons and principles into handy resources that the broader team can use.<br><br>So what is this writing for, then? This is my out-loud pre-work before we make those materials for the team.<br><br>I’m calling this series “Lean Security” instead of “Lean Software Development” because I’m coming at it from these two angles:<br><br></div><ul><li>What do risk &amp; security professionals need to understand about their product &amp; engineering customers?</li><li>What elements from Lean Software Development also apply to security practices &amp; products?</li></ul><div><br>We have to be careful with the second bullet.

Like other parts of consumer culture, we look for the latest \"advances\", the best bang-for-our-buck, the quickest thing, the most popular thing, the best advertised thing, or the super-utilitarian-just-get-the-nutrients-in-me thing.<br><br>Whichever of these we drift towards, our relationship with food moves away from thinking of food as something to enjoy in-and-of-itself, shifts away from cultural food traditions (with all their accumulated wisdom), and shifts away from (non-performative) eating with our community.<br><br>This reminder, then, is a simple call back to paying attention to what is being eaten. <br><br></div><blockquote>Take a small bite.<br>How does it smell?<br>How does it feel?<br>How does it taste?<br>Does it change as I chew or as it lingers in my mouth?</blockquote><div><br>Following this paradigm, a few things happen:<br><br></div><ol><li>I enjoy my food much more</li><li>I'm amazed how the tiniest of bites can give as much (or more) satisfaction as a large one</li><li>I realize that after more than a few bites of anything, I'm not enjoying anymore, but merely <em>consuming</em></li><li>I realize my fullness much more quickly</li><li>I can eat my foods in any order I want, because I won't overdue it with anything on my plate, but know I will move on once I am no longer enjoying that item</li></ol><div><br>Now, there is one big exception to this \"intuitive\" approach to eating. Some of these programs handle it, others may not. <br><br></div><pre>SUGAR is basically a drug.</pre><div><br>Sugar makes us more hungry. Seriously. Because of the way fructose and glucose work in the body, having sugar (and even simple carbs, which are effectively glucose) causes our bodies to store fat and ramp up our appetite. So, \"intuition\" gets short-circuited by our biological processes.<br><br>Pollan has lots of advice to help avoid this trap. <em>Naturally Slim</em> advocates cutting sugar. I'm not sure if <em>Intuitive Eating</em> handles it. (<a href=\"mailto:toddg@hey.com\">email me if you know?</a>)<br><br>Because I used a Pollan quote related to dessert, let me pair it with these other practices from <i>Food Rules</i>, in order to present the more-complete picture. Bold is Pollan's wording, italics are my comments.</div><div><br></div><ul><li><strong>4 Avoid food products that contain high-fructose corn syrup.</strong></li><li><strong>5 Avoid foods that have some form of sugar (or sweetener) listed among the top three ingredients.</strong></li><li><strong>35 Eat sweet foods as you find them in nature. </strong>(<em>e.g. whole fruit with fiber</em>)</li><li><strong>37 “The whiter the bread, the sooner you’ll be dead.”</strong></li><li><strong>39 Eat all the junk food you want as long as you cook it yourself. </strong>(<em>e.g. if you want pie, chips, or ice cream you gotta make it from the raw ingredients!</em>)</li></ul><div><br>In the week ahead, this is a good reminder for me to be mindful. To <em>eat</em> rather than <em>consume</em>. May it be helpful for you, as well.<br><br><em>tagged: </em><a href=\"https://www.craft.do/s/QNA4regH74fiMk\"><em>@Eat</em></a></div><div>---<br>-<a href=\"https://todd.grotenhuis.info/\">Todd</a></div>\n</div>\n<br><hr><i>Originally posted at <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/toddg/sunday-quote-4da30cc7\">Hey World</a></i>\n",

				"title": "Processing my Leadership Competency Survey",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n",
				"content_text": "<div class=\"trix-content\">\n  <div>Yes, I'm processing these \"out loud\" on the Internet. Writing helps me work through it and keeps me honest to myself. I won't share all the details, but will share a few notes along the way.<br><br><em>The Background:<br></em>All the leaders in my broader group (think: my boss's boss's group, about 800 people) are going through a leadership curriculum. As part of this, we had a leadership competency survey that went to our manager, a small number of self-selected peers, and a small number of self-selected stakeholders. There were 27 questions rated 1-5, with 3 questions for each of the 9 competencies that were being measured.<br><br><em>Initial Observations:</em></div><ol><li><strong>Benchmark:</strong> One of the first things I looked at was whether I exceeded the benchmark score. This was not simple vanity: it's at the top of the report. The summary shows how I scored myself overall, how each of the respondent groups rated me overall, and how the broader respondents rated everybody (the benchmark). I'm happy to see that I exceeded the benchmark, but without a view of the distribution I can't tell for sure how significant the difference is. I realize I <em>should not spend too much time here</em>, as it's comparative with others and not necessarily fruitful.</li><li><strong>Perception Gaps: </strong>Next, the survey advises to be wary of gaps between the self-rating and those of respondents, or between types of respondents. They suggest that 1 point (in either direction) is cause for concern. I've made progress here! In other community assessments (e.g. EQ360) in years past, I significantly underrated myself. I'm pleased that I still erred towards under-estimation, and that the margin of under-estimation has dropped to 0.28 points (on that 5-point rating scale). My goal is to continue to get that closer to 0, but as long as there is an error, I'd rather it be on the side of under-estimation. I had no major gap between respondent group types, which indicates I'm not overly-prioritizing some audiences over others. Later in the report we'll look at gaps on specific rating areas.</li><li><strong>Competencies:</strong> Across the 9 competencies, mine were all clustered around the same rating (only 0.27 difference between my best and worst), with scores I'm happy with. The only surprising result here was \"Dare to Be Curious\" being my worst. Why? Because <em>curiosity</em> is one of my primary approaches, especially in challenging moments or situations. Looking at the three questions that contributed to that competency rating, my lowest result (4.6) was for <em>\"Asks the 'right' questions to size up or evaluate situations\"</em>. I know that sometimes I go too quickly to brainstorming and solving instead of asking coaching-style questions. I'll continue to work on this practice. Here is the ranking of my competencies, in order:<ol><li>Model the Way</li><li>Value Every Voice</li><li>Respect Differences</li><li>Connect with Purpose</li><li>Improve and Grow</li><li>Partner for Success</li><li>Embrace Transparency</li><li>Make it Happen Today</li><li>Dare to Be Curious</li></ol></li></ol><div><br><em>Breakdown:<br></em>I like the way they've looked at the four quadrants based on self-rating and respondent rating.

(_and then on that page I can see backlinks to this reference!_)\n\nThe tasks can be checked off and completed.\n\nFinally, just as I’ve linked out to other places, I have backlinks inbound to this date from other places. I can follow those links to see the connections.\n\n_Not pictured_: I can add in-app sketches, scanned notes, documents, or images to my daily page.\n\n### Other Factors\n\nI also keep a document that is my intake document, so all items that come in from OSX or iOS sharesheet go there first.\n\nI have templates, including day start, week start, and week end. These include processing that intake inbox, making sure new notes have the correct home, and completing my planning and review activities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI’m finding this process works very well for me. It’s easy to stick with. It let’s me keep everything in one place. It lets me find and search for what I need, easily. It’s not ugly. It’s fun to work with.\n\nWould something like this work for you? What questions do you have?\n\n[^1]: Note: the 2nd and 3rd spaces will move to  [\"Craft Connect\" and \"offline spaces\"](https://www.craft.do/whats-new/b/87714FD1-ECBA-4B40-B084-767136D51B6D/V1.2.2_-_Craft_Connect,_Improved) for additional privacy and control, when those become available in the near future.\n\n[^2]: Though as with much in Craft, you can edit how things are visualized, more-so even than in some word-processing documents, and including in some ways that are unique to Craft.\n\n[^3]: You can’t see *unlinked* references to a page, yet, but this is a feature they are considering.\n",

With so many strengths related to <em>Strategic Thinking</em>, there is a chance that nothing comes of all that thinking. Analysis paralysis. Theory without practice. Cheap talk.</p>\n<p>All this strategic thinking needs to actually be <em>useful</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"so-what-are-we-going-to-do-about-it\">So what are we going to do about it?</h3>\n<p>We need an antidote for thought-without-action. Luckily, <strong>Activator</strong>, my #1 strength, is just what the doctor ordered! The <strong>Activator</strong> theme is precisely about turning thoughts into action.</p>\n<p>Leading from this strength means I’m always looking at what’s next, bringing energy and excitement to it. Having a vision of a future is great, but it starts to become reality when I&rsquo;m spurring myself and others to actually get moving in that direction. I don’t leave important conversation without concrete next steps, even if those steps are small ones. Building on that excitement and momentum is key to getting change happening.</p>\n<p><strong>Activator</strong>, combined with my <em>Strategic Thinking</em> strengths, means I&rsquo;m eager to actually test out theories and get rapid feedback. We can get real data to know if the approach needs to change, move full speed ahead, or be shelved to make room for something better. Innovative ideas plus rapid feedback cycles are how we evolve.</p>\n<p>My so-far-unmentioned top talents also relate to <strong>Activator</strong>, too. With <strong>Connectedness</strong>, I am often bringing people together and sharing the broader picture, both of which helps people rally around the cause. <strong>Command</strong> and <strong>Self-Assurance</strong> mean people often look to me to make tough decisions in risky situations, reassure or inspire them, and help remove roadblocks &amp; barriers. These, too, help us make progress even with things are hard.</p>\n<p>But again, there is a drawback to all this quick movement, motivation, and momentum. I can impatient and tough. I have to be careful not to set too high of standards or push too hard, or I risk burnout and hurting relationships. To counter this, I must repeatedly go back to the <em>Strategic Thinking</em> strengths: pushing hard <em>only</em> where it makes a big &amp; lasting difference, making sure we have time to recharge &amp; reflect, and adapting systems to make changes more sustainable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-about-you\">What about you?</h3>\n<p>Do you know your strengths?

A whopping 6 of my top strengths are related to strategic thinking.\n* “R” stands for “relationship building”. **Connectedness** is my top strength related to relationship building and **Individualization** (not pictured) is my second highest.\n* “E” stands for “executing”. **Belief** and **Responsibility** (not pictured) are my top strengths related to execution.\n\nWith all that explained, what is the overall summary of my top strengths, and what do they say about the way I best approach life?\n\n### *Strategic Thinking* is a major theme\n\nThere are 8 themes related to _Strategic Thinking_, and they dominate my top strengths. \n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2021/76c29c82f5.jpg\" width=\"275\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nIf you know me at all, you've probably noticed that I'm continually learning, collecting insights, sifting through information to find the signals in the noise, clarifying situations, engaging in deep conversations, imagining possible futures, brainstorming, asking tough questions, analyzing paths of possible success & failure, and spending time in intentional reflection. \n\nMy _Strategic Thinking_ strengths mean that I can be a major help when it comes to creating a vision, breaking new ground, developing new ideas, setting direction, focusing our attention on what matters, changing systems, and accounting for changing factors.\n\nBut there’s always a downside, right? With so many strengths related to _Strategic Thinking_, there is a chance that nothing comes of all that thinking. Analysis paralysis. Theory without practice. Cheap talk. \n\nAll this strategic thinking needs to actually be _useful_.\n\n### So what are we going to do about it?\n\nWe need an antidote for thought-without-action. Luckily, **Activator**, my #1 strength, is just what the doctor ordered! The **Activator** theme is precisely about turning thoughts into action.\n\nLeading from this strength means I’m always looking at what’s next, bringing energy and excitement to it. Having a vision of a future is great, but it starts to become reality when I'm spurring myself and others to actually get moving in that direction. I don’t leave important conversation without concrete next steps, even if those steps are small ones. Building on that excitement and momentum is key to getting change happening.\n\n**Activator**, combined with my *Strategic Thinking* strengths, means I'm eager to actually test out theories and get rapid feedback. We can get real data to know if the approach needs to change, move full speed ahead, or be shelved to make room for something better. Innovative ideas plus rapid feedback cycles are how we evolve.\n\nMy so-far-unmentioned top talents also relate to **Activator**, too. With **Connectedness**, I am often bringing people together and sharing the broader picture, both of which helps people rally around the cause. **Command** and **Self-Assurance** mean people often look to me to make tough decisions in risky situations, reassure or inspire them, and help remove roadblocks & barriers. These, too, help us make progress even with things are hard.\n\nBut again, there is a drawback to all this quick movement, motivation, and momentum. I can impatient and tough. I have to be careful not to set too high of standards or push too hard, or I risk burnout and hurting relationships. To counter this, I must repeatedly go back to the _Strategic Thinking_ strengths: pushing hard _only_ where it makes a big & lasting difference, making sure we have time to recharge & reflect, and adapting systems to make changes more sustainable.\n\n### What about you?\n\nDo you know your strengths? How do you use them? \n",

And though I listen to less than I used to (due to more meetings and more podcasts &amp; audiobooks) I still really enjoy listening to music when I can. I explore new sounds and visit old favorites.

I like Bandcamp because they seem to treat the artists better than other sites, and they allow you to manage and re-download or stream the music you have bought through Bandcamp.

Apple has somewhat hidden this service, because they want you to use their streaming service. However, it&rsquo;s still there (look under &ldquo;Features&rdquo; at the very bottom of the main iTunes store page) and is a nice option to make your library available on all your devices. It takes all your apple music, plus anything you have in your chosen music folder (e.g. from CD rips or Bandcamp purchases) and either matches it to the iTunes version of the song, or uploads a copy for your devices to use, if they don&rsquo;t think they have it.

The top ten were:\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2021/c3f99a2af7.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"458\" alt=\"\" />\n\nThe top 3 tracks I definitely listened to on loop at some point in the year. Both  \"Computorr\" and \"Go Small\" could be theme songs for 2020.\n\n\"Computorrr\" ([listen](https://drumcorps.bandcamp.com/album/computorr)) is a gltchy, sample-filled, frenetic track that should have you dancing around and thinking about how technology works in our lives.\n\n> \"TV got your brain\"\n\n> \"I want to get online\"\n\n> \"I **need** a computer\"\n\n> \"We work with anybody else who's fighting the system\"\n\n\"Go Small\" ([watch & listen](https://youtu.be/9Mo3euMRaro)) is a simple, haunting, independent, somewhat-melodramatic track that evokes many feelings of the year.\n\n> \"when the world is drowned in flames\nwrite something you can understand\"\n\n> \"the earth is radiantly suicidal\nif there's any play in favor of survival, it's: _go small_\"\n\n--- \n\nWhat did you listen to this year? Any recommendations?.\n",

I enjoy reading fiction in a variety of formats: paper, audio, and ebook. A good narrator (such as James Marsters for the Dresden books) really makes an audiobook come alive.\n\nI try to get my physical books via [Bookshop.org](https://bookshop.org/shop/toddgrotenhuis) to support independent sellers. If I cannot find directly there, my next search is on [Indiebound](https://www.indiebound.org/?aff=resilient), for the same reason. I have collected my 2020 recommendations (both fiction and nonfiction) on a [Bookshop list](https://bookshop.org/lists/2020-recommendations-459efe07-b6bd-49eb-aef9-dccf011a914a) for easy perusal. That, and all of the individual book links, are affiliate links.\n\nFor audiobooks and ebooks, I recommend checking your local library using [Overdrive/Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) to borrow the digital books. Many digital booksellers have not adopted a good way for us to pass on, resell, or share digital books like we can with physical books (despite it being easier), so I recommend supporting the library system first.\n\n---\n\n### Recommended\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2021/490a4fa732.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"466\" alt=\"\" />\n\n\n* ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ [The Raven Tower](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780316388702) by Ann Leckie - This was a re-read.

				"content_html": "<p><em>To view other 2020 review posts, visit the <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html\">main post here</a>.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Outside of work, I had several projects this year. Frankly, I didn&rsquo;t have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s how different efforts turned out (or didn&rsquo;t):</p>\n<h3 id=\"resilient\">Resilient</h3>\n<p>Resilient (<a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/\">here</a>) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open &amp; Secure) to share helpful &amp; meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: &ldquo;security, society, sustainability, and self.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively&hellip;it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo; and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word&hellip;but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.</p>\n<p>So, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient\">Resilient book collection</a>. I wrote about <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography\">watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies</a>.  I made my <a href=\"https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam Research</a> graph (notes) from <a href=\"https://owasp.org/\">OWASP</a> and <a href=\"https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/\">CSO50</a> conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.</p>\n<p>I host <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/publish\">Resilient</a> on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I&rsquo;m concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people&rsquo;s time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider. I offer a comped subscription to people that I know who sign up, and to anyone else who asks.</p>\n<p>But I do think about the audience, the reach, and how often and how well I am delivering value to the audience. I&rsquo;ve not posted enough this year, and not done as much analysis as I would have liked. I keep wondering if I should kill the project and move the items into my general blog.</p>\n<p>Yet I also know there are folks specifically wanting or asking for the kind of material that <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/publish\">Resilient</a> provides, and it is the common theme of expertise in my life. So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!</p>\n<h3 id=\"northern-fires\">Northern Fires</h3>\n<p>I started the <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html\">Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project</a> in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, <a href=\"https://www.silentplanetband.com/\">Silent Planet</a>, has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song.</p>\n<p>The idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica). I haven&rsquo;t found people that are interested in joining up, yet, so I&rsquo;ve spent less time on this than on other reading.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a shame I deprioritized this, because there are many lessons from the Spanish Civil War that are incredibly relevant to the world, today. I&rsquo;m going to pick up reading and writing for this project more in 2021, even if others aren&rsquo;t reading the works along with me. Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works.</p>\n<h3 id=\"40-for-40\">40 for 40</h3>\n<p>I turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I&rsquo;d started collecting will probably make it into the next project&hellip;</p>\n<h3 id=\"dearkiddos\">DearKiddos</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/\">DearKiddos</a> was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church.</p>\n<p>This one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don&rsquo;t get burnt out on the project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inktober\">Inktober</h3>\n<p>I had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/\">a few entries and catch-up entries</a> which were frankly pretty bad&hellip;but I knew that going in. Though I wasn&rsquo;t consistent and didn&rsquo;t finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;ll do it in 2021, or not.</p>\n<h3 id=\"home-office\">Home Office</h3>\n<p>My spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office. Since both of us are working from home full time now (and for a while still to come, it looks like), we converted that room to her office and the guest room to my office.</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m happy with how my office is turning out, making it serene and suitable for focus. I installed two shelving units (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/11/07/like-many-i.html\">including this one</a>).  I have one more item I&rsquo;m still trying to get from Ikea, and I hope to get a reading chair when it seems safe to go shopping for those, again, but otherwise it&rsquo;s been very good. I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wet--wild\">Wet &amp; Wild</h3>\n<p>(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to call this.)</p>\n<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access).

				"content_text": "_To view other 2020 review posts, visit the [main post here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html)._\n\n---\n\nOutside of work, I had several projects this year. Frankly, I didn't have a lot of success. Though I am glad to have been able to work from home easily this year, the workload and stress were extreme this year, even in an industry that is already know for high rates of burnout, suicide, and addiction (that industry being cybersecurity). This will be my most personal post in the series, with the rest being more focused on external reviews, and more personal examens not going on the blog at all.\n\nHere's how different efforts turned out (or didn't):\n\n### Resilient\n\nResilient ([here](https://resilient.substack.com/)) is a project through my consulting LLC (Open & Secure) to share helpful & meaningful insights into various realms of resilience: \"security, society, sustainability, and self.\" \n\nI originally thought the main output would be podcast episodes, as several people had asked me to do a podcast. I found it difficult to get through writing, recording, re-recording, editing, etc. in a timely manner. While I am very comfortable with casual conversations, presenting to key or large audiences, and writing effectively...it feels like podcasting combines these communication styles in a way that undermines what makes me comfortable with any of those styles. In conversations and presentations, you can read your audience, adjust, and respond. You also have the grace of it being a \"work in progress\" and conversational. Yet podcasts go into the world more like the written word: something recorded as-is, lacking the interaction with the audience. Thus, it feels like it needs the more careful planning and precision of the written word...but is still expected to have the conversational tone. Thus, the amount of work it went into making even (admittedly amateur) episodes.\n\nSo, I wrote more instead of recording more. I shared about some security tools. I wrote a few posts about COVID very early in the pandemic. I reviewed a couple relevant books. I started a [Resilient book collection](https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient). I wrote about [watersheds and the importance of thinking about our local ecologies](https://resilient.substack.com/p/an-alternate-geography).  I made my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) graph (notes) from [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) and [CSO50](https://events.idg.com/event-series/cso50-conference-awards/) conferences available to my full subscribers (all of which are comped, except for one person who was comped and made a subscription anyway!). Even with the conferences, I was able to attend far fewer sessions than I would like, due to work overtaking even my vacation time.\n\nI host [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/publish) on a newsletter platform (one which allows for using RSS for the feed instead of email, and also supports the podcast episodes and forum/conversation posts). Like podcasts before, I'm concerned about the state of newsletters, with there being too many of low quality, too many not worth people's time, and the impact on the medium as a whole.\n\nI'm not looking to make big money on the Resilient. The primary reason it has a subscriber model at all was to keep some of the content opt-in and not available to the whole web (see concerns around podcasting, above). When I set the rate for subscription, I chose the cheapest option the provider allowed, and then added a discount on top of that via the payment provider. I offer a comped subscription to people that I know who sign up, and to anyone else who asks.\n\nBut I do think about the audience, the reach, and how often and how well I am delivering value to the audience. I've not posted enough this year, and not done as much analysis as I would have liked. I keep wondering if I should kill the project and move the items into my general blog.\n\nYet I also know there are folks specifically wanting or asking for the kind of material that [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/publish) provides, and it is the common theme of expertise in my life. So for now, it stays, and I look for ways to make it better as hopefully the stress and workload gets better in 2021. I welcome your feedback!\n\n### Northern Fires\n\nI started the [Northern Fires (Guernica) reading and writing project](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/05/03/ration-my-breath.html) in May. One of the most interesting bands to me these days, [Silent Planet](https://www.silentplanetband.com/), has a lyricist who includes many intelligent references in each song, and includes those in the liner notes (and YouTube video notes) for each song. \n\nThe idea of the project is to do a read through and discussion of those works for one of the songs: Northern Fires (Guernica). I haven't found people that are interested in joining up, yet, so I've spent less time on this than on other reading. \n\nIt's a shame I deprioritized this, because there are many lessons from the Spanish Civil War that are incredibly relevant to the world, today. I'm going to pick up reading and writing for this project more in 2021, even if others aren't reading the works along with me. Maybe some will glean points from my commentary or be inspired to read along with some of the works. \n\n### 40 for 40\n\nI turned 40 this year, and expected to have a nice vacation and get a start on a project where I would dole out 40 bits of experience. The vacation never happened (for obvious reasons) and between that, stress, and concerns about hubris, I abandoned this project. Much of what I'd started collecting will probably make it into the next project...\n\n### DearKiddos\n\n[DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/) was something I started doing to process my lessons-learned and offer them to the next generation. For nieces, nephews, friends of kids, and youth at church. \n\nThis one was well-received by several folks, and I plan to periodically do more. I have many topics queued up to write, and will plan to get more out over the next year. I am purposefully avoiding writing too many too fast, so that I don't get burnt out on the project.\n\n### Inktober\n\nI had some vacation in October this year and thought it would be a good way to join this tradition. I made [a few entries and catch-up entries](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/inktober/) which were frankly pretty bad...but I knew that going in. Though I wasn't consistent and didn't finish, I learned a lot (both about the drawing and the photography!) through the process. I'm not sure if I'll do it in 2021, or not.\n\n### Home Office\n\nMy spouse and I used to have one room that was storage and a shared office. Since both of us are working from home full time now (and for a while still to come, it looks like), we converted that room to her office and the guest room to my office.\n\nI'm happy with how my office is turning out, making it serene and suitable for focus. I installed two shelving units ([including this one](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/11/07/like-many-i.html)).  I have one more item I'm still trying to get from Ikea, and I hope to get a reading chair when it seems safe to go shopping for those, again, but otherwise it's been very good. I have a south-facing view, which means I get some nice views of the outdoors and sunlight.\n\n### Wet & Wild\n\n(OK, this title is a joke. I wasn't sure what to call this.)\n\nI've been looking for acreage within an hour and a half our our home. Something with at least a few acres (hopefully 10 or more) and some water (like a pond, or lake or creek access). I'd like to have a place to camp and eventually build a cabin/cottage to our unique specifications. I want to preserve some of our ecology and plant some trees, maybe even re-wilding a space, depending on it's current state. I also see it as an investment when a lot of investments are problematic, these days. \n\nI've found a few things that _sorta_ work with our criteria (including one I need to investigate further), but nothing yet that has made us move on a purchase. I'll keep my eyes open still in 2021, and am open to leads!\n\nI've also been getting prepped to go camping more, which I miss quite a bit. I got my [Biolite](https://www.bioliteenergy.com/) stoves tuned back up, am preparing to remediate my dad's old cooler (it has a crack in the internal lid), replaced our old tent, and got a cold weather sleeping bag. \n\n---\n\nWhat projects have you had this year? How did they go?\n",

				"content_text": "_To view other 2020 review posts, visit thee  [main post here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/29/review.html)._\n\n---\n\nIn addition to traditional newspapers & news magazines ([see that list here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/12/31/news-magazines-review.html)) I get some of my news via feed or newsletter. I send both to [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/).\n\nIf you're not familiar with feeds & feed readers, the basic idea is that instead of having to go and check a bunch of sites periodically for updates, you can list the ones that you like, and _have those items come to you_. Feed readers often add other functionality, too. For Inoreader, I like the ability to take in normal (RSS) feeds as well as newsletters and Twitter accounts. It also has filtering rules, so I can use criteria to hide or highlight certain items.\n\nThe net result is I don't have to wait for those things to hit my inbox nor do I feel the urge to obsessively check sites & social media. I can just periodically open up Inoreader and check them _on my schedule_ instead of having the schedule dictated to me.\n\nI check my feeds about once a day, see which items are worth my attention, and either read them directly if short, or export them to [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/) if they are longer or worthy of highlights. My highlights go to [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/todd54), where I keep all my reading notes for review.\n\n### Security & Technology\n\n* [I Am the Cavalry](https://www.iamthecavalry.org/feed/) - security for the public good\n* [O'Reilly](http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom) - their \"4-short links\" tech highlights, in particular\n* [Signal vs. Noise](https://m.signalvnoise.com/feed/) - the Basecamp/Hey blog\n* [Schneier on Security](https://www.schneier.com/blog/atom.xml) - security essays and links to security news\n* [Have I Been Pwned](http://feeds.feedburner.com/HaveIBeenPwnedLatestBreaches) - latest breaches announcements\n* [Krebs on Security](http://krebsonsecurity.com/) - security reporting\n* [Zack Whittaker: This Week in Security](this.weekinsecurity.com) - weekly security news roundup\n* [Low Tech Magazine](http://feeds.feedburner.com/typepad/krisdedecker/lowtechmagazineenglish) & [No Tech Magazine](http://feeds2.feedburner.com/NoTechMagazine)- simple low & no tech engineering solutions\n* [Simplifier](https://simplifier.neocities.org/index.html) - breaking down technology to its fundamentals\n* [Google Online Security Blog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GoogleOnlineSecurityBlog) and [Project Zero](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)- research and news from the google security teams\n* [CERIAS](http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/blog/rss_2.0) - the Purdue security research center\n* [Indy Hackers Job Board](http://indyhackers.org/jobs.atom) - what's moving in the Indy tech community  \n\n### News & Reporting\n\n* [Beautiful News](http://feeds.feedburner.com/beautifulnewsdaily) - though now over, this was year-long project to share good news through well-designed infographics\n* [Pro Publica](http://feeds.propublica.org/propublica/main) - investigative reporting\n* [Reveal](https://www.revealnews.org/feed/) - investigative reporting\n* [The Markup](https://themarkup.org/feeds/rss.xml) - \"big tech\" reporting\n\n### Essays & Longreads\n\n* [Edge.org](https://www.edge.org/feed)\n* [Longform](https://longform.org/feed.rss)\n* [Longreads](https://longreads.com/feed/)\n* [Aeon](http://feeds.feedburner.com/AeonMagazineEssays)\n\n### People & Opinion\n\n* [James Clear: Atomic Habits](https://click.convertkit-mail4.com/92u84qzqzpbnhw34vefw/qvh8h7h87m8x98il/aHR0cHM6Ly9qYW1lc2NsZWFyLmNvbS8zLTItMS9yZWZlcj9yaF9yZWY9OThkOGU0NTk=)\n* [Ed Batista: Executive Coaching](http://feeds.feedburner.com/EdBatista)\n* [Maciej Cegłowski: Idle Words](http://www.idlewords.com/index.xml)\n* [Michal Zalewski: lcamtuf](http://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/)\n* [Will Larson: Irrational Exuberance](https://lethain.com/feeds/)\n* [Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/archive/feed/)\n* [Ben Werdmüller](https://werd.io/?_t=rss)\n* [Shane Parrish: Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/feed/)\n* [Nicholas Carr: Rough Type](http://www.roughtype.com/?feed=rss2)\n* [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/en.atom)\n* [Front Porch Republic](https://www.frontporchrepublic.com/feed/)\n* [Jeremy Friesen: Take on Rules](https://takeonrules.com/feed.xml)\n* [Mr. Money Mustache](http://feeds.feedburner.com/MrMoneyMustache)\n\n### Faith & Health\n\n* [Waging Nonviolence](http://feeds.feedburner.com/WagingNonviolence)\n* [Experimental Theology](http://experimentaltheology.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/default)\n* [Everyday Fitness](https://everydayfitness.substack.com/feed/)\n* [Ekklesia Project](http://www.ekklesiaproject.org/feed/)\n* [Geez Magazine](http://feeds.feedburner.com/GeezArticles)\n\n### Other\n\n* [Standard ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/rss/new-releases) - a feed of classic books being published by this great free ebook standardization project\n* [Cool Tools](http://feedpress.me/CoolTools) - tool recommendations\n* [Shareable](https://www.shareable.net/blog/feed) - “people-powered solutions for the common good\"\n* [Cabin Porn](http://cabinporn.com/rss) - photography of cabins, interior and exterior (no, there is no nudity, and rarely any people)\n* [Hunter Angler Gardner Cook](https://honest-food.net/feed/) - recipes (and sometimes essays) for wild food\n* [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/feed.atom) - new project recommendations feed\n* [The Cramped](http://www.thecramped.com/feed/) - “celebrating the unique pleasures of analog writing\"\n\n### Mine\n* [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/) - an occasional newsletter, post, or podcast related to resilience: for security, society, sustainability, and self (please let me know if you want a comped full subscription)\n* [This Blog](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/subscribe/) - has a little bit of everything, often in short-form or micro posts\n\n---\n\nThis examen helped me clear up my feeds list by removing a lot of inactive or broken feeds, and also removing ones that I don't read very often.

I also read the [Alien 3 comic adaption](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781506708119).\n\nOverall, I read 25 comics this year. \n\nWhat comics did you read this year? Any recommendations?\n",

Thus, when I&rsquo;m in front of a screen for enjoyment, I&rsquo;m often reading or playing. When I&rsquo;m watching, I prefer something humorous, challenging, or both. I generally don&rsquo;t like passive entertainment.</p>\n<p>With the diffusion of shows and movies across streaming services (and Netflix &amp; Apple TV not playing nice together), I started using [JustWatch] (<a href=\"https://www.justwatch.com/\">https://www.justwatch.com/</a>) to track &ldquo;to watch&rdquo; lists. JustWatch let&rsquo;s me have a single watch list, and go to wherever I can stream (or rent or buy) the show or movie.</p>\n<p>This year, I continued my quixotic quest to &ldquo;watch all the sketch comedy&rdquo;. Here are some of the new (to me) ones I that I recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show\">A Black Lady Sketch Show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81036255\">The Iliza Shlesinger Sketch Show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81087498\">Astronomy Club</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We like to watch &ldquo;funny news&rdquo; at our house. My favorites are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver\">Last Week Tonight with John Oliver</a>: the in-depth segments cut deep but also discuss opportunities to do something about it.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931\">Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj</a>: a little less what-can-you-do-about-it and a little more in-depth. These could be heavy, which is probably why it&rsquo;s now cancelled.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/\">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>: I would occasionally watch the previous night&rsquo;s intro portion of this show while having my breakfast. I find Colbert (&amp; his writers) to be the funniest of the late night hosts. Also, lately, the moments where you can hear his wife (or their interactions) are charming.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers\">Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>:  Like the above, it was an occasional morning watch of the intro portion of the show. He pulled no punches on calling out problems in the USA presidential administration, to the point where I&rsquo;m frankly surprised he&rsquo;s been able to stay on the air.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At our house, we also enjoy some murder mysteries and &ldquo;police procedurals&rdquo;. Here are the couple that stood out for me this year:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/show/endeavour/\">Endeavour</a>: It&rsquo;s Inspector Morse when he was younger, and they do a brilliant job of creating the setting of each episode (which is really a movie): visually, historically, and audibly.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80216172\">Criminal</a>: the premise of these series  is that it&rsquo;s a very sparse set of the interview rooms and a couple hallways, yet they are able to do so much with it. ( <em>note: check for 4 different countries and languages; there are multiple versions with different stories</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are other shows that I recommend:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy\">Ted Lasso</a>: this is my <strong>top recommendation</strong> from this year. On top of being very funny, I appreciate how much maturity and humanity people show each other, even in the face of most of the characters going through something incredibly difficult.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p\">The Repair Shop</a>: this is an incredibly charming show about a shop where people bring in their antiques, family heirlooms, and broken items to be reconditioned. It&rsquo;s a brilliant spot of light in a throwaway consumerist culture, and there are wonderful moments of joy.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place\">The Good Place</a>: a hilarious show that introduces and mashes up a lot of philosophical concepts and questions</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hbo.com/watchmen\">Watchmen</a>: full disclosure, I hadn&rsquo;t seen the movie or read the comics before watching this spinoff TV show, but am familiar with their basic story line and themes. This was an incredible production that explores a number of both contemporary and timeless problems.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo\">Fargo</a>: like Watchmen, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I am riveted to every season of this show. What I like most about this show is the juxtapositions: beauty &amp; horror, fortune &amp; reversal, education &amp; gallows humor, and much more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD\">The Mandalorian</a>: yes, it&rsquo;s full of fan service, but it&rsquo;s <em>really well-done fan service</em> that re-explores many tropes in fresh ways.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK\">The Boys</a>: these comedy-horror comic book characters made it to TV, and it presents a scathing critique of various power structures.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)\">Community</a>: I wrapped up this series this year. It&rsquo;s intelligent and funny, but you really do have to watch from the beginning in order to understand the characters and their dynamic. Troy &amp; Abed will always have a special place in my heart for the way they portrayed nerdiness in a more authentic and <em>laughing-with</em> rather than <em>laughing-at</em> way.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.history.com/shows/alone\">Alone</a>: I generally shy away from &ldquo;Reality Shows&rdquo; due to vapidity, repetition, and manufactured melodrama. I will often check out survival shows, though (hey, Eagle Scout here!).  What I like about this one compared to some others is that you can see how they setup for the long haul, giving us a chance to see how challenges and priorities shift over the duration of their stay. (Of course, it&rsquo;s also relevant to my theme of <a href=\"https://resilient.substack.com/\">Resilience</a>.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Big Screen: I didn&rsquo;t watch a lot of movies this year (who did?), but here are the two that stuck with me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out\">Knives Out</a>: as I mentioned earlier, we enjoy murder mysteries in this house. This was a great twist on those tropes. (I feel like it&rsquo;s this generation&rsquo;s <em>Clue</em>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film)\">El Hoyo (The Platform)</a>: this minimalist dystopian horror film offers several critiques of the current age.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>What did you watch this year? Any recommendations?</p>\n",

My favorites are:\n\n* [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver](https://www.hbo.com/last-week-tonight-with-john-oliver): the in-depth segments cut deep but also discuss opportunities to do something about it.\n* [Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj](https://www.netflix.com/title/80239931): a little less what-can-you-do-about-it and a little more in-depth. These could be heavy, which is probably why it's now cancelled.\n* [The Late Show with Stephen Colbert](https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/): I would occasionally watch the previous night's intro portion of this show while having my breakfast. I find Colbert (& his writers) to be the funniest of the late night hosts. Also, lately, the moments where you can hear his wife (or their interactions) are charming.\n* [Late Night with Seth Meyers](https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers):  Like the above, it was an occasional morning watch of the intro portion of the show. He pulled no punches on calling out problems in the USA presidential administration, to the point where I'm frankly surprised he's been able to stay on the air.\n\nAt our house, we also enjoy some murder mysteries and \"police procedurals\". Here are the couple that stood out for me this year:\n\n* [Endeavour](https://www.pbs.org/show/endeavour/): It's Inspector Morse when he was younger, and they do a brilliant job of creating the setting of each episode (which is really a movie): visually, historically, and audibly.\n* [Criminal](https://www.netflix.com/title/80216172): the premise of these series  is that it's a very sparse set of the interview rooms and a couple hallways, yet they are able to do so much with it. ( _note: check for 4 different countries and languages; there are multiple versions with different stories_)\n\nHere are other shows that I recommend: \n\n* [Ted Lasso](https://tv.apple.com/us/show/ted-lasso/umc.cmc.vtoh0mn0xn7t3c643xqonfzy): this is my **top recommendation** from this year. On top of being very funny, I appreciate how much maturity and humanity people show each other, even in the face of most of the characters going through something incredibly difficult.\n* [The Repair Shop](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08l581p): this is an incredibly charming show about a shop where people bring in their antiques, family heirlooms, and broken items to be reconditioned. It's a brilliant spot of light in a throwaway consumerist culture, and there are wonderful moments of joy.\n* [The Good Place](https://www.nbc.com/the-good-place): a hilarious show that introduces and mashes up a lot of philosophical concepts and questions\n* [Watchmen](https://www.hbo.com/watchmen): full disclosure, I hadn't seen the movie or read the comics before watching this spinoff TV show, but am familiar with their basic story line and themes. This was an incredible production that explores a number of both contemporary and timeless problems.\n* [Fargo](https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/fargo): like Watchmen, I haven't seen the movie, but I am riveted to every season of this show. What I like most about this show is the juxtapositions: beauty & horror, fortune & reversal, education & gallows humor, and much more.\n* [The Mandalorian](https://www.disneyplus.com/series/the-mandalorian/3jLIGMDYINqD): yes, it's full of fan service, but it's _really well-done fan service_ that re-explores many tropes in fresh ways.\n* [The Boys](https://www.amazon.com/The-Boys-Season-1/dp/B07QNJCXZK): these comedy-horror comic book characters made it to TV, and it presents a scathing critique of various power structures.\n* [Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_(TV_series)): I wrapped up this series this year. It's intelligent and funny, but you really do have to watch from the beginning in order to understand the characters and their dynamic. Troy & Abed will always have a special place in my heart for the way they portrayed nerdiness in a more authentic and _laughing-with_ rather than _laughing-at_ way.\n* [Alone](https://www.history.com/shows/alone): I generally shy away from \"Reality Shows\" due to vapidity, repetition, and manufactured melodrama. I will often check out survival shows, though (hey, Eagle Scout here!).  What I like about this one compared to some others is that you can see how they setup for the long haul, giving us a chance to see how challenges and priorities shift over the duration of their stay. (Of course, it's also relevant to my theme of [Resilience](https://resilient.substack.com/).)\n\nThe Big Screen: I didn't watch a lot of movies this year (who did?), but here are the two that stuck with me:\n\n* [Knives Out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knives_Out): as I mentioned earlier, we enjoy murder mysteries in this house. This was a great twist on those tropes. (I feel like it's this generation's _Clue_)\n* [El Hoyo (The Platform)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Platform_(film)): this minimalist dystopian horror film offers several critiques of the current age.\n\n---\n\nWhat did you watch this year? Any recommendations?\n",

				"content_text": "<p><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781513805931\">I Am Not Your Enemy: Stories to Transform a Divided World</a></em> by <a href=\"https://michaelmcray.com\">Michael T. McRay</a></p><p>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, Highly Recommended</p><blockquote><p>The stories we tell and the ones we listen to change us all the time, in large and little ways, and <em>we'd do well to consider carefully which stories win our attention</em>.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p><em>Note: you can find this title and more on the <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/lists/resilient\">Resilient</a> booklist. Commsissions from sales from that list help acquire more books for review.</em></p><div><hr></div><h2>Summary</h2><p>From Palestine, Israel, South Africa, Northern Ireland, and the USA, we hear the stories of people working for peace. </p><blockquote><p>Through this book, we learn of the possibility of peace and of the practical requirements of forgiveness and reconciliation. Can you reconcile while injustice continues? Can you forgive those who burned down your home while still living in its ruins?</p></blockquote><p><em>— from the Foreword by Ishmael Beah</em></p><p>McRay takes care with the stories of the people he interviews, presenting their varying experiences with authenticity and grace. Peace is not an easy process, and we see time and again that the work is long and hard.</p><blockquote><p>…it can take as long to get out we of a conflict as it took to get in it. </p></blockquote><p>But the work is important, and we can continue to get better at it.</p><h2>Takeaways</h2><p>#1: Peacemaking requires both Reconciliation <em><strong>and</strong></em> Justice</p><p>A common theme through the stories is that these two objectives are dependent on one another:</p><blockquote><p>Reconciliation that isn't interested in the injustices that are dividing people is shallow at best and sinister at worst. And any effort at justice that addresses the basic needs of security and sustenance but pays little attention to the quality of compassionate relationship between people is like trying to build the frame of a ship without any adhesive.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>There's something about the language of reconciliation that can seem friendlier to those in power and an enemy to those suffering, while language of justice may be the exact opposite.</p></blockquote><p>Those of us with power must be willing to admit it and learn to share it if we hope to make lasting progress:</p><blockquote><p>…<em>true</em> reconciliation threatens the power structures. Reconciliation needs to be dealing with creating healthy, right relationships, which must mean dealing with power imbalances. Inequality in power, access, distribution of resources—all these tear at any hope of deep relationship.</p></blockquote><div><hr></div><p>#2: “Free the oppressed and you might free the oppressor too”</p><p>Obviously the oppressed need to be freed, but how about the oppressor? You may have heard this sort of idea before, but could have had trouble visualizing it or making it concrete.</p><p>There are a couple ways in which even the perpetrators of harm need to be freed:</p><p><strong>First,</strong> they can be freed to regain their humanity. Continuing to uphold systems of harm degrades one’s ethical and moral center. It burdens the soul. It is an albatross.</p><p><strong>Second</strong>, they can be freed from constant vigilance: </p><blockquote><p>“…but I fear they will kill us if we don't control them. It's the cost of security.”</p></blockquote><p>Those who uphold systems of oppression have a background anxiety that people who’ve been harmed are going to come “settle up”. This fear and constant vigilance often leads to things such as:</p><ul><li><p>additional spending or effort on security</p></li><li><p>isolation and conclaving</p></li><li><p>reactionary measures and escalations</p></li></ul><blockquote><p>Walls like these often rise in response to fear.... But I think walls become self-fulfilling prophecies.</p></blockquote><p>Our freedoms are bound together.</p><div><hr></div><p>Have you read this book? What takeaways did you have?</p><div><hr></div><h2>Definitions</h2><p>The book detailed a few terms that are worth sharing:</p><ul><li><p>“single stories” - stories that strip complexity from people and reduce them to narratives without nuance (source: <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story\">Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</a>)</p></li><li><p>“single identity work” - the work that groups should do within the group, before working with other groups where there is conflict (this is the group version of “work on yourself, first”)</p></li><li><p>“contact hypothesis” - the (disbunked) idea that just getting to know people will solve or prevent conflicts</p></li><li><p>“sulha” - seeking to dismantle the occupation and secure freedom through nonviolence (source: Usama, a Palestinian interviewed for the book)</p></li><li><p>“refuseniks” - Israeli soldiers who refuse to serve in occupied Palestine (<em>note: there are other historical uses of this term as well, and it can also mean Israeli conscientious objectors more generally) </em></p></li></ul><h2>Additional Quotes</h2><blockquote><p>What makes for peace is the capacity to live with difference in such a way that bears fruit rather than arms. Difference and disagreement are guaranteed for human relationships. More often than not, it's how we <em>deal with</em> difference, rather than <em>being</em> different, that determines our potential to be peaceable.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>The stories we tell either help us or harm us. No narrative is neutral. The ones that help are usually ones that tell bold truths about our world, even painful ones, because we always need to face the truth with courage if we're to heal and grow. The ones that hurt are usually ones that distort truths—maybe to protect power, or dehumanize, or tempt us to weaponize our fear. We humans tend to do our worst when we're afraid. Fear leads to hatred and hatred leads to violence and violence leads to fear, which leads to hatred, which leads to violence. If we don't address this deadly cycle, it can loop forever. </p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>Building empathy for the sake of empathy, however, isn’t enough. It should lead to compassionate action for improving the world....Empathy that does not lead toward constructive efforts for personal and social improvement isn't of much use to anyone.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>...religion and difference need not be markers of division. It's not written in stone anywhere that hospitality and affection shall be suspended in the company of difference. In fact, it's in the presence of difference that hospitality is often most needed.</p></blockquote><p></p><blockquote><p>…everyone who benefits from an unjust system and is not actively working to dismantle it is at least partly responsible for its harm.</p></blockquote><p>What can you do to help bring reconciliation and justice?</p><p></p>\n",

				"content_html": "<p>📚 Finished Reading: <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781940939230\">An Unintentional Accomplice</a></em>  by Carolyn L. Baker ⭐️⭐️⭐️</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>Note: I received a free pdf of this book, with the agreement to provide a review when complete.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>: people who like autobiographies and who want to pursue racial justice</p>\n<p>Gabrielle David, African American woman and publisher of 2Leaf Press, gave guidance to the author and also wrote the introduction. Here is David in the introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some would suggest that it is the systems that are broken. But none of these systems are broken; it is white people who are broken, but they do not have to be. And broken is not evil. Broken means it can be fixed. Healed. Changed. And recently, quite a few white people are stepping up to acknowledge, repair, and heal. This is what Baker has set out to do, to understand a complicated American structure that holds us all hostage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The systems, it turns out, are working as designed. Our unexamined assumptions, intentions, and practices need to be re-evaluated, and then we can work together to design systems with better outcomes for all.</p>\n<p>—</p>\n<p>After the introduction, Baker takes us through the phases of her life, chapter by chapter.

				"content_text": "📚 Finished Reading: _[An Unintentional Accomplice](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781940939230)_  by Carolyn L. Baker ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/c3a8f985ed.jpg\" width=\"119\" height=\"187\" alt=\"\" />\n\n_Note: I received a free pdf of this book, with the agreement to provide a review when complete._\n\n**Recommended for**: people who like autobiographies and who want to pursue racial justice\n\nGabrielle David, African American woman and publisher of 2Leaf Press, gave guidance to the author and also wrote the introduction. Here is David in the introduction:\n\n> Some would suggest that it is the systems that are broken. But none of these systems are broken; it is white people who are broken, but they do not have to be. And broken is not evil. Broken means it can be fixed. Healed. Changed. And recently, quite a few white people are stepping up to acknowledge, repair, and heal. This is what Baker has set out to do, to understand a complicated American structure that holds us all hostage. \n\nThe systems, it turns out, are working as designed. Our unexamined assumptions, intentions, and practices need to be re-evaluated, and then we can work together to design systems with better outcomes for all.\n\n—\n\nAfter the introduction, Baker takes us through the phases of her life, chapter by chapter. Along the way, she examines the ways that she may have benefited from white privilege, and the ways she may have allowed or perpetuated racial injustices. This, in reference to the title, is her being **an accomplice**. Each chapter is a vignette of her growing awareness of those challenges, and grappling with her thought patterns around them.\n\nOne of the interesting angles to Baker’s reflections is that it is clear that throughout her life she has been socially-conscious in many ways, and has spent much of her life serving others.

				"title": "#DearKiddos: A Vaccine for Cruelty",
				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/\">#DearKiddos</a>:</p>\n<p>I was reading this article today from <em>the Economist</em>: <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights\">“No Vaccine for Cruelty”</a> (<a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg\">image</a>).</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.</p>\n<p>The article says &ldquo;no vaccine&rdquo;, but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let&rsquo;s give this a shot.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-authoritarians-rise\">How authoritarians rise</h2>\n<p>First, by &ldquo;authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They&rsquo;re sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they&rsquo;re almost always men) or tyrants.</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Make everyone afraid</li>\n<li>Blame someone for it</li>\n<li>Claim to be the savior</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that&rsquo;s the vaccine!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"make-everyone-afraid\">Make everyone afraid</h2>\n<p>There are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that&rsquo;s genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!</p>\n<p>As you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even <strong>caused</strong> by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to <strong>do something</strong>, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n<p>First, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by <strong>being</strong> hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. <em>Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?</em></p>\n<p>Another way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (<em>sorry, that’s the topic for another post</em>), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who is the original source of this information?</li>\n<li>Is this mostly facts or opinions?</li>\n<li>Is this showing things in only the worst way?</li>\n<li>Who are they trying to scare?</li>\n<li>Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (<em>Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blame-someone-for-it\">Blame someone for it</h2>\n<p>The next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called &ldquo;scapegoating&rdquo; or setting up a &ldquo;fall guy&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>This is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It&rsquo;s a sad way to create fake togetherness. It&rsquo;s &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on <em>hope</em> was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)</p>\n<p>Now, it&rsquo;s true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He&rsquo;s trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces.</p>\n<p>So what&rsquo;s our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?</p>\n<p>One thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us.

				"content_text": "[#DearKiddos](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/dear-kiddos/):\n\nI was reading this article today from _the Economist_: [“No Vaccine for Cruelty”](https://www.economist.com/international/2020/10/17/the-pandemic-has-eroded-democracy-and-respect-for-human-rights) ([image](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/e58d38cef5.jpg)).\n\nIt's about how people in political power have done nastier and nastier things during the COVID-19 crisis, and have largely gotten away with it.\n\nThe article says \"no vaccine\", but I want to try to give you one, anyway. A vaccine is a medicine you take to make it so that you can get through it when a nasty infection comes your way. So let's give this a shot.\n\n## How authoritarians rise\n\nFirst, by \"authoritarian”, I  mean someone who takes away power and choice from the people, and keeps that power with threats and violence. They're sometimes called strongmen (and yes, they're almost always men) or tyrants.\n\nThere's a pretty well-know path to getting this kind of power. It goes basically like this:\n\n1. Make everyone afraid\n2. Blame someone for it\n3. Claim to be the savior\n\nLet's break that down a bit, and talk about what we can do ahead of time to prevent getting sick from it (that's the vaccine!).\n\n## Make everyone afraid\n\nThere are several ways the strongman can go about this. Sometimes, they will simply put lots of attention on something that's genuinely scary (example: financial problems, pandemics). Other times, they will create chaos by encouraging people to fight amongst themselves (example: encouraging racism). Other times, they will create boogeymen (example: conspiracy theories and communist scares). Other times, they will allow things to get bad via neglect (example: climate change). Often, they do more than one of the above!\n\nAs you can see from these short examples, the fear could be real, made up, or even **caused** by the strongman. The main point is that they want to increase fear, because fear makes us want to react. When we’re afraid, we want someone to **do something**, and they want to be the one to offer that something (see phase 3).\n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nFirst, we can practice gratitude, thankfulness, and hope. One simple way to do this is to have a time each day where you think about what you are thankful for. You can even write this in a gratitude journal, or share what you are thankful for with friends, family, or church. For hope, we can build hope by **being** hope. When we work with others to give and receive help, we build hope for both us and them. We can feel the difference, imagine a better future, and trust in one another. _Can you think of other ways you might practice gratitude, thankfulness, or hope?_\n\nAnother way we can protect ourselves is to be thoughtful when people are trying to scare us. This is extra true in news and social media. Unfortunately, because most of the places we get our news are driven by advertising (_sorry, that’s the topic for another post_), they are likely to tell stories in a way that scare us, because it gets us to click, tune in, share, etc. So, our news does a lot of the work for the strongman. But we should still ask ourselves questions like:\n\n* Who is the original source of this information?\n* Is this mostly facts or opinions?\n* Is this showing things in only the worst way?\n* Who are they trying to scare?\n* Does the story feel inspirational or does it feel demotivational? (_Meaning: does it make us want to solve a problem together, or does it make us feel alone and angry?_)\n\nThere will always be some truly bad news, for sure. But with these types of questions, you can start getting your news from better sources, and you will more likely know when someone is trying to make up, exaggerate, or misuse bad news.\n\n## Blame someone for it\n\nThe next step of the strongman is to convince you that a person (example: their political opponent) or a group of people (example: a race, class, region, or religion) are to blame. Specifically, that they are to blame for the things that the strongman has been trying to scare you about. You might hear this called \"scapegoating\" or setting up a \"fall guy\". \n\nThis is a powerful trick, because it gives scared people something to agree on, to join together in blaming. It's a sad way to create fake togetherness. It's \"belonging\" through a common enemy. (This is another reason that working together on _hope_ was so important: it creates real unity instead of false unity.)\n\nNow, it's true that there may be someone or some people who are partially or wholly responsible for problems that you are experiencing (and it might even be the strongman himself, as we saw in phase 1!). But the strongman is not trying to truly diagnose the problem and work together on a solution. He's trying to whip up anger, to create a mob, to create vigilantes, and/or to bring in his own forces. \n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nOne thing we can do ahead of time is to have met or know people that are different from us. We can live in neighborhoods where there are people with different backgrounds. We can go to schools where everybody doesn't look like us. We can make friends with people with different experiences than us. When we travel, we can learn from and be respectful to the people that are local to the area. We can be part of groups and activities where we meet people who think or act differently. Here's why: when you know people that are in the accused group, it's hard for someone to convince you that they are the enemy, because you'll be able to see that the lies and stereotypes aren't true.\n\nAlso, along the lines of _hope_ from phase 1, we can build teams, support, and organizations that serve people and solve problems. When we're used to doing work to make the world a better place, we know that problem-solving is rarely an us-vs-them situation, it's usually something where diversity actually helps in finding new solutions!\n\n_What other ideas do you have for protecting us against the hateful blame game?_\n\n## Claim to be the savior\n\nAt this point, the cycle of blame and fear has ramped up, because the blaming has created more division and fueled fear further. Now the strongman makes the claim to be the savior. They tell you \"look, I know what the problems are...I warned you about them\" (back when they made people afraid) and \"I know how to solve it...I told you who is at fault\" (back when they blamed people). See what's happening here?\n\nThey will tell you they are the only one smart enough to see it all, and strong enough to do something about it. They will often use the language of \"law & order\", meaning that they will wield power, control, and even violence over the groups that they setup to take the blame.\n\nSo what's our vaccine for this stage of the cruelty?\n\nIf you've been following along, you're probably noticing that the strongman isn't really following tradition & law, and is actually creating disorder or at least adding to it. You're right, the claim to “law & order” is a lie, but that doesn't really register for the people who are already afraid and bought into the blame game. That means the best way to defend against phase 3 here is to defend against phase 1 and phase 2, as we discussed above.\n\nThat said, if you're a person of faith (or even if you're not!), you should be wary of anyone who claims they're the only solution to your problems. It's healthy to be a bit cautious (\"skeptical\") of power, and one of the things we can do ahead of time is to build our organizations and institutions in ways where power is shared among more people.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAuthoritarians are seizing more power around the world right now, and it will likely happen again in your lifetime. But when you and your community practice some of these defenses, you can help limit the times it will happen, and lessen the damage that comes when it does.\n",

People, wildlife, and the entire ecology within a watershed are all part of the same stream of life. </p><p>In addition, ecological health is tied to financial health, and both are affected by community interactions and governance within the region. Their fate flows together.</p><p>Thus, the thought experiment of using the terms: <em>Nation, State, County, City, Township, Neighborhood</em>.</p><p>Political boundaries can often feel arbitrary, based on agreements or impositions that may have had very little to do with the people that actually live in the area (or were even contrary to their interests, such as in colonial situations).</p><p>But watersheds are based on shared life. Regardless of wealth, ethnicity, or other factors, people within a watershed have shared destiny.</p><h2>So what?</h2><p>What would it mean to think of our local watershed as our polity, our political unit?</p><p>Could we become better at seeing our neighbors as people in the same boat, rather than as enemies?</p><p>Could we more readily identify how systems are interacting?</p><p>Could it enable more long-term thinking, strategic thinking, thinking that considers not just the current moment but the impact to the financial, social, and ecological health of the region?<br><br>How is the health of your watershed? What might you do, knowing that?</p>\n",

Why? The first reason is that in some businesses or non-business organizations, operations are either having to halt, scale way down, or even scale way up. The second is that some organizations are moving to a great amount of work from home.</p><p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibility for BCP activities:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Make sure your info/documentation is up-to-date on contacts, including the fact that people may not have access to their work phone #s</p></li>\n<li><p>Also check that you have contact info for those “jurisdictional” contacts outside your org (e.g. health, emergency services, city, county, state, etc.)</p></li>\n<li><p>If you rely on teams that are engaged on a retainer basis to help during crisis, verify whether they still have capacity for you, due to the widespread nature of the event</p></li>\n<li><p>As always, review any lessons you are learning along the way, so that you can create action plans to iteratively improve</p></li>\n</ul><p>Here are a few tips if you have any responsibilty supporting increased Remote Work:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Make a plan for how physical assets are leaving (and eventually returning) to your physical locations</p></li>\n<li><p>If you’re not already operating on Zero Trust Networking principles, verify that critical systems require additional protection beyond requiring VPN for access (adding multifactor authentication and enhanced monitoring, for example)</p></li>\n<li><p>Evaluate your ability to continue to protect the end-user devices that are connecting to your systems: Can you keep them updated? Do you have EDR (endpoint detection and response) capabilities fully deployed? Can you define a “good” device through NAC (network access control) rules and quarantine bad devices until they meet specifications?</p></li>\n<li><p>If folks are accessing most of your systems through an online suite (such as O365, Zoho, or GSuite), evaluate those configurations towards security standards and make critical changes</p></li>\n<li><p>Work with your monitoring teams (such as NOC and SOC) to re-evaluate your expectations around what are standard behaviors and what activities need to be reviewed and/or escalated</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><h1>Society</h1><p>The safety measures we are taking will put extra strain on some segments of our society. Here are a few thoughts as we work through these times:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Avoid hoarding, so that those with great need still have access.  This goes both for physical goods but also for consumption of services and manipulation of markets.</p></li>\n<li><p>People are losing work and income during this time. Can you reach out to give or receive assistance? Maybe through a an organization you’re part of?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there people in your life that need to hear from you? Or who you need to check in with? Get a call or video chat going.</p></li>\n<li><p>As organizations do away with <a href=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2020/03/15/what-will-happen.html\">BS, punitive, or unnecessary measures</a>, hold them accountable not to reinstate them.</p></li>\n</ul><p>If you’re a praying person, consider the following prayer. Even if you’re not, you may find the items to be good contemplative ideas to spur action and support:</p><blockquote>\n<p>May we who are merely inconvenienced<br>Remember those whose lives are at stake.</p>\n<p>May we who have no risk factors<br>Remember those most vulnerable.</p>\n<p>May we who have the luxury of working from home<br>Remember those who must choose between preserving their health or making their rent.</p>\n<p>May we who have the flexibility to care for our children when their schools close<br>Remember those who have no options.</p>\n<p>May we who have to cancel our trips<br>Remember those that have no safe place to go.</p>\n<p>May we who are losing our margin money in the tumult of the economic market<br>Remember those who have no margin at all.</p>\n<p>May we who settle in for a quarantine at home<br>Remember those who have no home.</p>\n<p>As fear grips our country,<br>let us choose love.</p>\n<p>During this time when we cannot physically wrap our arms around each other,<br>Let us yet find ways to be the loving embrace of God to our neighbors.</p>\n<p>Amen.</p>\n</blockquote><p>From <a href=\"http://krugthethinker.com/2020/03/prayer-for-a-pandemic/\">Prayer for a Pandemic</a>.</p><div><hr></div><h1>Sustainability</h1><p>As we reduce our commuting, travel, and trips around town, we have an opportunity to evaluate our behaviors, and see what habits might stick. This has the potential to reduce petroleum-based travel and move us towards renewables-based vehicles/transportation, better food-production ecosystems, and people-centered cities.</p><p>Here are some questions to ponder:</p><ul>\n<li><p>For those of you working from home, could you continue to work from home after this is over? For at least a portion of the time?</p></li>\n<li><p>Which meetings need to still exist? Which <em>of those</em> still need to be in person?</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are going outside more to get out of the house, is this building up your inspiration and capacity for walking, biking, and other people-powered transport? Could this stretch the radius in which you opt to walk or bike instead of getting in a car?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there edifying and/or relaxing places that you'd like to visit, which don’t require a plane trip?</p></li>\n<li><p>If you order in, or drive through, can you avoid the plastic utensils and containers? Maybe bring/use your own?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are you cooking more at home? Could you keep doing more of that? Are there local farmers you can support?</p></li>\n<li><p>Have you had to give up how much meat you consume? Could you keep eating less meat and fewer animal products?</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><h1>Self</h1><p>If you’re following the safety tips in the introduction, you are already doing an important part to help slow the spread and ensure that people will have access to medical care. The tips and questions in the <em>security</em>,<em> society</em>,<em> </em>and <em>sustainability</em> sections are not intended to cause panic, but rather present food for thought that could help make things better now and in the future.</p><p>Through the period of uncertainty, it’s important to continue to take care of yourself. Again, some thoughts:</p><ul>\n<li><p>Take your meds, cook good food, and stay on your plan</p></li>\n<li><p>If you work with any kind of therapist(s), see if there are options for continuing that work, maybe through video</p></li>\n<li><p>If you feel overwhelmed, call a crisis hotline if you need it (1-800-273-8255) or get help via services like betterhelp or talkspace</p></li>\n<li><p>Talk to your loved ones and your communities of support (faith and service organizations, for example)</p></li>\n<li><p>Get some exercise at home and take walks in open &amp; natural spaces</p></li>\n<li><p>Give yourself grace when you feel down</p></li>\n<li><p>Practice gratitude for the things that are going well</p></li>\n</ul><div><hr></div><p>I hope you found this helpful. <br>Is there anything obvious we missed?

Often, we think of productivity as the One True Measurement (TM) of success, and I’m not sure that’s right.\n\nWhile effectiveness (towards whatever goal(s) you set) is important, it leaves out factors such as quality, value, repeatability, learning, etc. You could argue that we should build those into the measurements of productivity, but I’d argue we often don’t.\n\nPerhaps my disagreement is due to me being philosophically less of a consequentialist and more of a deontologist or virtue ethicist. In my way of thinking, it’s better to do right with less immediate output than to crank out good output that may be short-sighted.\n\nWhat about you?\n\n_edited to add: Cal addresses this a somewhat when he gets into \"busyness\" being a (bad) proxy for \"productivity\"._\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Sunday, 13 years ago (2007), my spouse and I joined our <a href=\"http://www.indymenno.org/\">Mennonite community and church</a>.</p>\n<p>You might be surprised that a Mennonite is here on the Internet, talking about things like cybersecurity. So let me give you the world’s shortest history of Mennonites and a few quick points about modern Mennonites.</p>\n<h2 id=\"history\">History</h2>\n<p>Mennonites are descendants (sometimes literally) of the reformation, specifically, what’s often called the “radical reformation.” In that movement, the radical reformers believed that that one’s place of birth or government should not dictate one’s religion, and that one should profess their faith once they were capable of freely accepting one. For this, the label \"anabaptists” or “re-baptizers” was used as an epithet, and it stuck.</p>\n<p>Anabaptists also opted out of the violence and warring between religious and political factions, choosing to disassociate or flee to a new location, as needed. They practiced a “priesthood of all believers”, meaning that there was no formal clergy and that all were called to hold each other accountable in interpretation and life. They put a focus on Jesus’s teachings and life, not just his birth and death.</p>\n<p>None of these stories are without exception, and I could write several other posts about the asterisks. But I promised you a short history.</p>\n<p>Modern Anabaptists include Mennonites, Amish, Hutterites, Bruderhof, Church of Brethren, Brethren in Christ, and several variations on all these.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modernmennonites\">Modern Mennonites</h2>\n<p>Here are what I see as the most-common traits of modern Mennonites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reconciliation: conflict mediation, healing relationships, restoring ecology, practicing redemption, disaster-relief</li>\n<li>Peacemaking: nonviolent struggles for peace &amp; justice, echoing the voices of the voiceless, reducing harm, operating from subversive &amp; prophetic weakness instead of domination</li>\n<li>Simplicity: living intentionally, being kind to animals &amp; the earth, humility, avoiding consumerism</li>\n<li>Christocentrism: viewing the whole of the Bible through the lens of Jesus’s teaching and action, seeing the image of God in our neighbors &amp; enemies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, this is very short list with exceptions omitted. If you want to read a short book with more, I’d recommend <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780836199833\">The Naked Anabaptist</a></em> or (somewhat longer) <em><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9781513802497\">The Upside Down Kingdom</a></em>.</p>\n",

				"content_text": "<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2020/655cfd3650.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"337\" alt=\"\" />\n\n## Overview\nI set a goal of reading 63 books in 2019, which was a 10% increase over 2019. I met this goal exactly. I have again increased my goal by 10% and plan to read at least 70 books in 2020.\n\nAbout half of the books I read (31, to be exact) were non-fiction. I seek books that may be  \"eye-opening\": those that challenge my understanding, worldview, and conceptions. I look for books of criticism, history, philosophy, ethics, theology, psychology, business, economics, and politics.\n\n## How I Read\nFor nonfiction, I get the books multiple ways. If I'm not sure I'll like it and don't expect I'll need to take a lot of notes, I look for the audiobook or summary first in my [Scribd subscription](https://www.scribd.com/g/6xggmi) and then [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby/) (to borrow digitally from my local library). If I know I'll want to reference the book a lot after finishing it, I order a hardback via [Indiebound](https://www.indiebound.org/indie-bestsellers?aff=resilient) or [Alibris](https://www.alibris.com/). If I expect to learn a lot and/or take lots of highlights and notes, I'll borrow the ebook via Libby or buy it from an ebook seller.\n\nMy book (and article) highlights and notes from all sources go automatically into [Readwise.io](https://readwise.io/), where I review 15 highlights each day to aid in retention and reflection. This is one of the ways I start my day, and it's incredibly valuable.\n\nI rate books between ⭐️ and ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️, with ⭐️⭐️⭐️ being the cutoff for a worthy book. Thus, I will only share about the ⭐️⭐️⭐️ through ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ books, here.\n\n## Recommended Books\n### ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \n\n* _[How To Be An Antiracist](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780525509288?aff=resilient)_ by Ibram X.

I encouraged them not to have the same things as each other in 3 and 4.

I also used the Risus variant where you look at the <em>best</em> die in the roll, instead of the total. To play, when they wanted to do something interesting with an uncertain outcome, I asked them to describe it, told them which of their cliches was appropriate, and gave them a difficulty between 6 and 10.  I also brought in the Risus conflict rules, again using versus instead of totals.</p>\n<p>I also brought in “bennies” to the system, in order to give us a little more flexibility. I awarded them 1 at the start of their mission, and told them they’d get another any time I thought they did something really interesting or clever. They could give me a bennie when they failed a roll and wanted to re-roll it. However, when I got a bennie from then, I could put it back in the pool to add a twist to the story.

Microsoft shares data that it <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-using-multi-factor-authentication-blocks-99-9-of-account-hacks/\">can block 99% of attacks</a>. </p><p>However, like Facebook before, Twitter <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/information-and-ads\">has has used those secondary security factors as marketing tools</a>. On advertising platforms (like Twitter, Google, and Facebook), advertising will always take top priority, so other factors like security may suffer.</p><p>In related news: advertising companies are also unlikely to support end-to-end encryption (<a href=\"https://freedom.press/training/blog/newsrooms-lets-talk-about-gsuite/\">as with Google</a>), and thus your data and systems are vulnerable to government interventions &amp; pressures.</p><p>Speaking of those pressures, <a href=\"https://dymaxion.org/essays/coercionresistantdesign.html\">Coercion-Resistant Design</a> refers the idea of building things such that it’s harder for outside parties to force you to subvert the security of your system, whether due to “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-hose_cryptanalysis\">rubber hose-cryptanalysis</a>”, nation-state impositions, extortion, or any other type of coercion. In the linked article, Elanor Saitta considers many angles on how to build in coercion-resistance. </p><div><hr></div><p>In <a href=\"http://www.davefarley.net/?p=285\">Continuous Compliance</a>, Dave Farley talks about how teams might build in compliance verification into their CI/CD processes. As IT auditors frequently lag behind technology trends, this is one way to build in compliance requirements and demonstrate them in a way that is understandable. </p><div><hr></div><p>The FBI’s warrantless searches <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/secret-court-fbi-warrantless-searches-were-illegal\">have been declared illegal</a>. This is good news, as searches need to be:</p><ul><li><p>Based on cause</p></li><li><p>More targeted</p></li><li><p>Given strong oversight</p></li></ul><p>As stated in the news article, though, this is not the end of the struggle to make this program safer.</p><h1>Sustainability</h1><p>More research and planning is needed, but it looks like <a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/08/20/gassy.html\">adding a small amount of a certain type of seaweed to cattle feed will have a major impact on methane emisssions</a>, and thus greenhouse gases.  </p><div><hr></div><p><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gyzykq/you-dont-need-an-iphone-11-unless-your-current-phone-is-literally-unusable\">The practically, morally, and financially responsible thing to do is to use your current phone for as long as possible.</a> This is an important reminder when new devices come out. Similar for cars, continuing to service whatever you have is better for sustainability than the making of a new one, even if that new one is zero emissions once it gets on the road.</p><div><hr></div><p>I was totally unaware of the <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a26038/the-blood-of-the-crab/\">role that horseshoe crabs play in our medical system</a>. Hopefully we can find another way to meet these needs.</p><h1>Society</h1><p>Over at Waging Nonviolence, they <a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/2019/08/right-wing-media-creating-antifa-shooter-narrative-out-of-thin-air/\">demonstrate how pundits and politicians fabricate narratives</a>, by examining the news cycle of how antifascists got scapegoated as the “real danger”, instead of the fascists that they organize against.</p><div><hr></div><blockquote><p>No wonder we’re all so skeptical and cynical these days. Because we have a million good A/B-optimized reasons to be.</p></blockquote><p>A quote from “<a href=\"https://m.signalvnoise.com/lets-stop-shaking-people-down-for-their-email-addresses/\">let’s stop shaking people down for their email addresses</a>”, where the folks at Basecamp once again bring some much-needed simplicity and intentionality to business.</p><h1>Self</h1><p><a href=\"https://overcast.fm/+Ei1A7l8W8\">Leading Above the Line</a> is another great interview of Jim Dethmer.</p><div><hr></div><p>A personal reflection on minimalism and loss: <a href=\"https://nosidebar.com/the-best-tribute/\">“what if minimalism is the best tribute to a memory or person?”</a></p><div><hr></div><p>A short video from Aeon: <a href=\"https://aeon.co/videos/time-seems-to-accelerate-as-we-get-older-but-theres-a-tested-way-to-tap-the-brakes\">on time-perception and aging</a>.

The drafters of the resolution received help from Iglesia Menonita Hispana, delegates, and the resolutions committee. It has the support of the Executive board and sufficient delegate signatures to be brought to the delegates.</p>\n<p>As the resolution was read to the delegates, it ended with a standing ovation. <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0\">You can read the text here.</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>We had another equipping study with Tom Yoder Neufeld. This time, we continued into chapters 4-6 of Ephesians, and how we live in God’s blessing.</p>\n<p>Tom tells us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not walk alone</li>\n<li>God walks with us</li>\n<li>We walk with others</li>\n<li>The unity of the Spirit is the <em>basis</em> not the <em>result</em> of walking together well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And we exhibit the following characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Humility</li>\n<li>Patience</li>\n<li>Suffering each other (forbearance)</li>\n<li>Forgiveness (gracing each other as God has graced us)</li>\n<li>Seeing the face of God in each other</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Using the wording and imagery of the text, Tom imagines us as “chain gang of peace”, trying to run together, like in the poster for <em>O Brother Where Art Thou?</em>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>\n<p>We should be patient “seventy times seven”, but if bonds break, it should be with “grief” not “good riddance.”</p>\n<p>Tom reminds us that “the unity of the Spirit is bigger, wider, and deeper than any of our organizational structures.”</p>\n<p>In Q&amp;A, we were reminded that the pain is often on the party in the margins or minority. But we need to put the greater burden on the side with power, not the other way around.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Next, we discussed the proposal to formally add youth delegates (aged 16-21). This would include 1 per congregation, 2 per conference, and 2 per racial-ethnic constituency group.</p>\n<p>It was clarified that current delegates can come from this age group, but that this codifies adding some specifically of that age range.</p>\n<p>The measure passed nearly-unanimously with only 6 of 495 delegates dissenting.</p>\n<p>I interviewed one of those dissenting, later. They were not against youth being delegates, only the way it was being implemented (as additional count and bylaw changes). They were afraid it cemented that youth are separate and different, rather than integrating them more. They would have preferred we simply passed a resolution granting Step Up members voting status.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In the afternoon session, we discussed the leadership discernment slate. The Gifts Discernment team worked to fill roles at least 50% women, and at least 20% people of color. The slate had 48% women and 40% people of color.</p>\n<p>After reviewing <a href=\"http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nominee-info-and-pics-for-KC-2019.pdf\">the slate</a>, they were approved unanimously.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Glen Guyton presented the plan for a new communications strategy. It would focus on a unified identity-building communications approach for MCUSA. It would also include <em>The Mennonite</em> going independent from MCUSA and joining <em>Mennonite World Review</em>.</p>\n<p>I personally expressed concerns about how <em>The Mennonite</em> needing to become financially self-sustainable could lead to commercialization and the related negative effects that commercialization has on news. From Glen’s response, it sounds like those factors are being considered.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In addition to the youth delegate changes to the bylaws, we also reviewed the other adjustments to the bylaws, <a href=\"http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf\">which you can read here</a>.</p>\n<p>These changes (including removing a reference to telegram!) were passed unanimously.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Next, Michael Danner led a discussion on the membership guidelines, so that the executive board could get a sense of how our constituencies are feeling about handling membership guidelines.</p>\n<p>We were asked to score both how important amending the guidelines is to our constituencies, and then how much energy we have to put into it over the next two years.</p>\n<p>They also asked for our comments. Several comments from my table and others mentioned that the <a href=\"https://www.bmclgbt.org/\">Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pinkmenno.org/\">Pink Menno</a> have people willing to advise on the process and wording for the guidelines. This would help limit some of the effort and pain that might otherwise have to be played out in local churches.

				"content_text": "_[Day 5](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/06/mennocon-delegate-report.html), [Day 4](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/05/mennocon-delegate-report.html), [Day 3](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/04/mennocon-delegate-report.html), [Day 2](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/03/mennocon-delegate-report.html), [Day 1](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/07/02/225359.html)_\n\nWe again had two delegate sessions today, with us now moving into more of the “business” for the week.\n\n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2019/6f1acf7c5c.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"371\" alt=\"\" />\n\nFirst, the resolution committee brought forward a new resolution that was generated this week: **Churchwide Statement on the Abuse of Child Migrants**. The drafters of the resolution received help from Iglesia Menonita Hispana, delegates, and the resolutions committee. It has the support of the Executive board and sufficient delegate signatures to be brought to the delegates.\n\nAs the resolution was read to the delegates, it ended with a standing ovation. [You can read the text here.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2kcvpb8gs4bwbcc/Churchwide%20Statement%20on%20the%20Abuse%20of%20Child%20Migrants%20-%20draft.pdf?dl=0)\n\n---\n\nWe had another equipping study with Tom Yoder Neufeld. This time, we continued into chapters 4-6 of Ephesians, and how we live in God’s blessing.\n\nTom tells us: \n\n* We do not walk alone\n* God walks with us\n* We walk with others\n* The unity of the Spirit is the *basis* not the *result* of walking together well\n\nAnd we exhibit the following characteristics:\n\n* Humility\n* Patience\n* Suffering each other (forbearance)\n* Forgiveness (gracing each other as God has graced us)\n* Seeing the face of God in each other\n\nUsing the wording and imagery of the text, Tom imagines us as “chain gang of peace”, trying to run together, like in the poster for _O Brother Where Art Thou?_ \n<img src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2019/2bb0a96cb9.jpg\" width=\"408\" height=\"600\" alt=\"\" />\n\nWe should be patient “seventy times seven”, but if bonds break, it should be with “grief” not “good riddance.”\n\nTom reminds us that “the unity of the Spirit is bigger, wider, and deeper than any of our organizational structures.”\n\nIn Q&A, we were reminded that the pain is often on the party in the margins or minority. But we need to put the greater burden on the side with power, not the other way around. \n\n---\n\nNext, we discussed the proposal to formally add youth delegates (aged 16-21). This would include 1 per congregation, 2 per conference, and 2 per racial-ethnic constituency group. \n\nIt was clarified that current delegates can come from this age group, but that this codifies adding some specifically of that age range.\n\nThe measure passed nearly-unanimously with only 6 of 495 delegates dissenting.\n\nI interviewed one of those dissenting, later. They were not against youth being delegates, only the way it was being implemented (as additional count and bylaw changes). They were afraid it cemented that youth are separate and different, rather than integrating them more. They would have preferred we simply passed a resolution granting Step Up members voting status. \n\n---\nIn the afternoon session, we discussed the leadership discernment slate. The Gifts Discernment team worked to fill roles at least 50% women, and at least 20% people of color. The slate had 48% women and 40% people of color. \n\nAfter reviewing [the slate](http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Nominee-info-and-pics-for-KC-2019.pdf), they were approved unanimously. \n\n---\n\nGlen Guyton presented the plan for a new communications strategy. It would focus on a unified identity-building communications approach for MCUSA. It would also include _The Mennonite_ going independent from MCUSA and joining _Mennonite World Review_.\n\nI personally expressed concerns about how _The Mennonite_ needing to become financially self-sustainable could lead to commercialization and the related negative effects that commercialization has on news. From Glen’s response, it sounds like those factors are being considered.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to the youth delegate changes to the bylaws, we also reviewed the other adjustments to the bylaws, [which you can read here](http://mennoniteusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Bylaw-Updates-for-2019-Delegate-Assembly-after-Eds-input-May-13.pdf).\n\nThese changes (including removing a reference to telegram!) were passed unanimously.\n\n---\n\nNext, Michael Danner led a discussion on the membership guidelines, so that the executive board could get a sense of how our constituencies are feeling about handling membership guidelines. \n\nWe were asked to score both how important amending the guidelines is to our constituencies, and then how much energy we have to put into it over the next two years.\n\nThey also asked for our comments. Several comments from my table and others mentioned that the [Brethren Mennonite Council for LGBT Interests](https://www.bmclgbt.org/) and [Pink Menno](http://www.pinkmenno.org/) have people willing to advise on the process and wording for the guidelines. This would help limit some of the effort and pain that might otherwise have to be played out in local churches. As we discussed above, we want less of the burden to fall on those with less power.\n\n---\n\nBoth worship services today focused on the movement of the Spirit, a topic that may have felt uncomfortable for some Mennonites. But the Energy, the Breath, the Wind blew through our worship space, surprising us with new things.\n",

We then shared some of the insights with the group.\n\nWe saw Jesus being born in or visiting the margins. We saw Jesus in the tent camps, immigrant detention centers, women’s shelters, and more. We wondered about where Jesus would proclaim hope, and what  the “woes” and “blessed” statements might be.\n\nWe looked for where Jesus would have righteous fury with us or with systems. Perhaps Jesus would challenge us with why we haven’t been making disciples. Or how our rules, traditions, and barriers keep people from feeling welcome in our churches. Maybe Jesus would storm into hospitals and throw medical billing into the incinerators.\n\nMaybe Jesus would ask us why we haven’t been loving each other?\n\n---\nMay we continue to look for Jesus in our midst and in our margins.\n",

Conversely, if your technology disrupts, say, public transport or the social welfare system, you’re punching down: your platform negatively affects people with less power than you.

If not, [head over to read it](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/02/16/digital-minimalism-reference.html) and then come back here.\n\n_(Note: I did a podcast on my experiment from this book, over at [Resilient](https://resilient.substack.com/p/digital-declutter))_\n\n# Why\n* To better understand what technologies and practices are worthwhile and valuable for me.\n* To focus more on high-value activities\n* To spend more time reflecting, thinking, and praying.\n* To spend more time reading, creating, repairing.\n* To spend more time in nature.\n* To reset my habits and routines.\n* To help fight the attention economy and the harmful effects it has for discourse, complex thought, and mental health.\n\n# What\nI am avoiding any unnecessary technologies, and using these questions to help me consider whether a technology is truly critical:\n\n* Is this absolutely necessary?\n* Could this wait?\n* Does this align with my highest values? (_Mutuality, Learning, Resilience_)\n* Can I mitigate the harmful effects?\n* Is there another way to accomplish this, even if it would be inconvenient?\n\nI am blocking off time twice a day to check email (once in the morning and once in the afternoon), and letting it buffer in between.\n\nI have eliminated most applications from my phone and blocked social & news sites in my browsers. The only alerts I get from my phone will be for direct people connections (texting, work chat, phone calls, video calls, etc.) or travel (rides, flights, directions, etc.), and my phone will be in \"Do Not Disturb\" except for core work hours (7-6). My DND is set to allow calls from numbers that are in my contacts.\n\nI will do all my (professional and personal) work from the computer and not my phone.\n\nI will not play video games, read ebooks, or play music & podcasts.\n\nI will do my shopping in stores and I will use the library.\n\nI am establishing operating procedures for my chosen special cases:\n\n* I can listen to audiobooks, but only with my family\n* On the weekend, I can watch a movie or couple episodes, but only with family or friends\n* I have direct links to Facebook Group/Event pages that I need to check periodically, and will check those once a week\n\n# When\nI'm beginning tonight, with the start of our [Ash Wednesday service](http://www.indymenno.org/calendar/) and the beginning of Lent.\n\nI'm ending on Easter Sunday (April 21st on this calendar) and the end of Lent. \n\nI am holding \"conversation office hours\" every day between 4:30 and 5:30 Eastern.

During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful.

For each technology you reintroduce, determine <em>what value it serves</em> in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"taking-the-break\">Taking the Break:</h2>\n<p>Evaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Newport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.</p>\n<p>Two methods to “take a break” are <strong>bans</strong> and <strong>operating procedures</strong>. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.</p>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. <em>Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"reintroducing-technologies\">Reintroducing Technologies</h2>\n<p>To be reintroduced, a technology must:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Serve something you <em>deeply</em> value</li>\n<li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value</li>\n<li>Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”</p>\n<h1 id=\"practices\">Practices</h1>\n<p>One of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.</p>\n<p>Thus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”</p>\n<p>During your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-spend-time-alone\">Practice Area: Spend Time Alone</h2>\n<p>One of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Solitude Deprivation</em>: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Time with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine &amp; regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.</p>\n<p>Newport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels. As I mentioned at the beginning, we know our negative emotions are targeted for reaction, but on top of that we are also repeatedly presented with “curated” versions of others’ selves, and finally, the systems are designed for us to continually seek the repeated micro-approvals of others. The attention economy is engineered in a way that drives anxiety.</p>\n<p>Thus, the following practices help us have time without input from “other minds”, to help restore some control, attention, and mindfulness to our lives.</p>\n<p>Through these practices, Newport recommends:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Conversation Centric Communication</em>: Conversation is the only form of interaction that in some sense counts toward maintaining a relationship&hellip;.Anything textual or non-interactive—basically, all social media, email, text, and instant messaging—doesn’t count as conversation and should instead be categorized as mere connection. In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information&hellip;. Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On to the practices:</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-leave-your-phone-at-home\">Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home</h3>\n<p>It may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-take-long-walks\">Practice: Take Long Walks</h3>\n<p>By yourself. Without your phone.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-write-letters-to-yourself\">Practice: Write Letters to Yourself</h3>\n<p>AKA write in notebooks. Take notes, journal, brainstorm, plan.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-dont-click-like\">Practice: Don’t Click “Like”</h3>\n<p>“No reacts plz”, we might say. This goes back to the micro-approvals and anxiety I mentioned above, as they drive the slot-machine behavior of social media sites. If you must react, share a comment. Or your own writing. Or even better, have a conversation with the person. “Adopt the baseline rule that you’ll no longer use social media as a tool for low-quality relationship nudges.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-consolidate-texting\">Practice: Consolidate Texting</h3>\n<p>Keep your phone in Do Not Disturb and only check according to an operating procedure. Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-hold-conversation-office-hours\">Practice: Hold Conversation Office Hours</h3>\n<p>Pick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-reclaim-leisure\">Practice Area: Reclaim Leisure</h2>\n<p>All this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.</p>\n<p>Here are the three principles, then, of leisure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption</li>\n<li>Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world</li>\n<li>Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-fix-or-build-something-every-week\">Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week</h3>\n<p>Per principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-schedule-your-low-quality-leisure\">Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality Leisure</h3>\n<p>Per your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-join-something\">Practice: Join Something</h3>\n<p>Join a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-follow-leisure-plans\">Practice: Follow Leisure Plans</h3>\n<p>This may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.</p>\n<p>Newport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"practice-area-join-the-attention-resistance\">Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance</h2>\n<p>At this point in history, “extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-delete-social-media-from-your-phone\">Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone</h3>\n<p>Once you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-turn-your-devices-into-single-purpose-computers\">Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers</h3>\n<p>This is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-use-social-media-like-a-professional\">Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional</h3>\n<p>People who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-embrace-slow-media\">Practice: Embrace Slow Media</h3>\n<p>Slow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780830841141\">Slow Church</a> movement.\nEmbrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.</p>\n<p>Avoid junk and reactivity. Avoid “Breaking News”, which is almost always low-quality, error-prone, and often emotionally manipulative.</p>\n<p>Seek opposing viewpoints. Follow feeds from good writers. Save/bunch stories to read once a week.</p>\n<h3 id=\"practice-dumb-down-your-smartphone\">Practice: Dumb Down Your Smartphone</h3>\n<p>Consider a dumbphone, no phone, or something like the <a href=\"https://www.thelightphone.com/\">Light Phone</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/\">Punkt Phone</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h1>\n<p>I liked this book and look forward to implementing my break and examination during Lent.

				"content_text": "[Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780525536512) by Cal Newport ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\n_(Note: I wrote about my own experience with Digital Declutter [here](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/2019/03/06/digital-declutter-the.html).)_\n\n# Premise\nYou’ve probably already heard: billions of dollars are spent on psychology and technology to claim as much of your attention as possible, to sell as much advertisement possible. The addictiveness of sites, apps, and phones is not an accident, but rather a result carefully engineered to be just so.\n\nIn addition, “darker emotions attract more eyeballs than positive and constructive thoughts”, so we are pushed towards outrage, anxiety, and despair.\n\nVarious attempts have been made to lessen the negative side effects and addictive properties of modern attention-economy technologies, but they’ve largely been unsustainable. \n\nWhat to do? Newport Recommends **Digital Minimalism**.\n\n# Manifesto\n_Digital Minimalism_ - _A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support the things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else._\n\nDigital Minimalism includes avoiding “low-value activities that can clutter up [our] time and attention and end up hurting more than they help.” It also means asking ourselves “is this the best way to use technology to support this value?” The law of diminishing returns also applies, here.\n\n## The Principles\n1. Clutter is costly\n2. Optimization is important\n3. Intentionality is satisfying\n\nSummary quote from this section:\n\n> The sugar high of convenience is fleeting and the sting of missing out dulls rapidly, but the meaningful glow that comes from taking charge of what claims your time and attention is something that persists.\n\n# Digital Declutter Program\nNewport recommends an intentional process to reassess your needs and values.\n\n> Put aside a thirty-day period during which you will _take a break from optional technologies_ in your life. During this thirty-day break, explore and rediscover activities and behaviors that you find satisfying and meaningful. At the end of the break, _reintroduce optional technologies_ into your life, starting from a blank slate. For each technology you reintroduce, determine _what value it serves_ in your life and how specifically you will use it so as to maximize this value. \n\n## Taking the Break:\nEvaluating “optional” can be grey, but Newport gives this guideline:\n\n> consider the technology optional unless its temporary removal would harm or significantly disrupt the daily operation of your professional or personal life.\n\nNewport also warns us to not confuse “convenient” with “critical”, when analyzing our needs during this period.\n\nTwo methods to “take a break” are **bans** and **operating procedures**. A ban is simply not using that site, tech, app, etc. during the period. Operating procedures entail using it under certain rules. For example, many test participants in the program moved many tasks to their laptop/desktop that they had often completed on their phones, or checked certain apps/sites only once a week, or during a certain window, or in a certain place.\n\nIn summary:\n\n> In the end, you’re left with a list of banned technologies along with relevant operating procedures. _Write this down and put it somewhere where you’ll see it every day._\n\n## Reintroducing Technologies\nTo be reintroduced, a technology must:\n\n1. Serve something you _deeply_ value\n2. Be the _best_ way to use technology to serve this value\n3. Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies how you use it\n\nFor the last item, this means asking “How am I going to use this technology…to maximize its value and minimize its harms?”\n\n# Practices\nOne of the side effects of the engineered attention economy is that we’ve become accustomed to distract ourselves at the slightest moment of boredom or uncomfortable introspection. In addition, cutting out mindless swiping and browsing will introduce a lot of free time. If we don’t have a plan to proactively use our freed time, our Digital Minimalism practice is likely to fail.\n\nThus, Newport introduces some possible practices to help us positively spend some time with our own thoughts, reclaim our free time as quality leisure, and further join the “Attention Resistance.”\n\nDuring your tech break and again in your reintroduction, see which of these would be good to include in your habits.\n\n## Practice Area: Spend Time Alone\nOne of the challenges of the attention economy is that we are frequently stuck in:\n\n> _Solitude Deprivation_: A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds\n\nTime with our own thoughts is important, in short, for mindfulness. It’s important for the ability to consider problems, to examine & regulate emotions, reflect on values, and more.\n\nNewport refers to the mounting evidence regarding how the attention-economy is drastically driving up anxiety levels.

In this philosophy, connection is downgraded to a logistical role. This form of interaction now has two goals: to help set up and arrange conversation, or to efficiently transfer practical information.... Connection is no longer an alternative to conversation; it’s instead its supporter.\n\nOn to the practices:\n\n### Practice: Leave Your Phone at Home\nIt may feel impossible, but this is a very recent feeling. If you’re concerned about emergencies, consider leaving it off, or in the glovebox of your car, for example. (Again, this is implementing operating procedures.)\n\n### Practice: Take Long Walks\nBy yourself. Without your phone.\n\n### Practice: Write Letters to Yourself\nAKA write in notebooks.

Setup your DND to allow calls through from critical contacts. \n\n### Practice: Hold Conversation Office Hours\nPick a time when you are open for free conversation. Maybe it’s your commute. Maybe it’s literally open office hours. Maybe it’s a recurring walk. Whatever it is, offer this time as an opportunity for conversations. \n\n## Practice Area: Reclaim Leisure\nAll this freed time can lead to existential anxiety or produce negative behaviors (mindless consumption, alcohol/drug abuse, etc.) to fill the void. Newport claims giving more thought, attention, and effort to our leisure will make it more fulfilling and restorative, and help us keep on the Digital Minimalism path.\n\nHere are the three principles, then, of leisure:\n\n1. Prioritize demanding activity over passive consumption\n2. Use skills to produce valuable things in the physical world\n3. Seek activities that require real-world, structured social interactions\n\n“The value of the pursuit is often proportional to the energy invested.”\n\n### Practice: Fix Or Build Something Every Week\nPer principle #2, this should be analog. Newport recommends trying to learn and apply a skill each week over Digital Declutter period.\n\n### Practice: Schedule Your Low-Quality Leisure\nPer your operating procedures, you should decide when, how much, how, etc. For example, maybe you only stream TV with family and friends, and only for X hours on the weekends. Maybe you only check in on Facebook events, groups, and family pictures for an hour on the weekends. In Newport’s findings, “the vast majority of regular social media users can receive the vast majority of the value these services provide their life in as little as twenty to forty minutes of use per week”, as opposed to the 3+ hours that the average person spends daily on their smartphones.\n\n### Practice: Join Something\nJoin a club, meetup, organization, etc. Or start your own!\n\n### Practice: Follow Leisure Plans\nThis may sound backwards, but actually planning your leisure may give you more opportunities to do it, by prioritizing it in your schedule.\n\nNewport recommends a seasonal plan and weekly planning. \n\n> A good seasonal plan contains two different types of items: objectives and habits that you intend to honor in the upcoming season. The objectives describe specific goals you hope to accomplish, with accompanying strategies for how you will accomplish them. The habits describe behavior rules you hope to stick with throughout the season.\n\n> For each of the objectives in the seasonal plan, figure out what actions you can do during the week to make progress on these objectives, and then, crucially, schedule exactly when you’ll do these things.\n\n## Practice Area: Join the Attention Resistance\nAt this point in history, “extracting eyeball minutes, the key resource for companies like Google and Facebook, has become significantly more lucrative than extracting oil.”\n\n### Practice: Delete Social media from Your Phone\nOnce you have your operating procedures around use, you probably don’t need it there, anyway.\n\n### Practice: Turn Your Devices Into Single-Purpose Computers\nThis is about focus and not multi-tasking. Of course computers are general purpose machines, but “the power of a general-purpose computer is in the total number of things it enables the user to do, not the total number of things it enables the user to do simultaneously.”\n\n### Practice: Use Social Media Like a Professional\nPeople who work with Social Media for their job typically have operating procedures to be effective.\n\n> Have a careful plan for how you use the different platforms, with the goal of “maximizing good information and cutting out the waste.”\n\nFor example, fix the signal-to-noise ratio by being careful about what and who you follow.\n\n### Practice: Embrace Slow Media\nSlow Media or Slow News is like the Slow Food or [Slow Church](https://bookshop.org/a/10222/9780830841141) movement. \nEmbrace the patient, high-quality, well-considered sources and conversations.\n\nAvoid junk and reactivity. Avoid “Breaking News”, which is almost always low-quality, error-prone, and often emotionally manipulative. \n\nSeek opposing viewpoints. Follow feeds from good writers. Save/bunch stories to read once a week. \n\n### Practice: Dumb Down Your Smartphone\nConsider a dumbphone, no phone, or something like the [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) or the [Punkt Phone](https://www.punkt.ch/en/products/mp02-4g-mobile-phone/).\n\n# Conclusion\nI liked this book and look forward to implementing my break and examination during Lent. Want to discuss the book? Message me and let’s have a conversation!\n\n[#DigitalMinimalism](https://blog.grotenhuis.info/categories/digital-minimalism/)\n",

				"content_text": "> Strange invaders land on the shores of a peninsula known for its independence; rumors about their true purpose are numerous and varied. Two old friends reunite after more than a decade, brought together by a young man looking to advance himself in the world.\n\nOur book is a consolidated collection of Actual Play fiction for a [Burning Wheel](https://www.burningwheel.com/burning-wheel/) campaign that ran for more than sixty sessions over the course of two years.\n\nEloy Cintron was GM. [Neil Goodrich](mailto:ngoodr@gmail.com) (Alistair), Jose Lozada (Aedan), and I (Gyles) were players.

I think we’re seeing this play out more and more.\nTo save this community, I think it would need to focus more on the tangibles of the games themselves (what system, design, or theme issues matter to the community?) and less on the nostalgic “member berries”. And it would need a new name that represents those things.\n",

It's been one of my favorite works for several years. Here's one of our readings from today:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have heard numerous southern religious leaders admonish their worshipers to comply with a desegregation decision because it is the law, but I have longed to hear white ministers declare: 'Follow this decree because integration is morally right and because the Negro is your brother.' In the midst of blatant injustices inflicted upon the Negro, I have watched white churchmen stand on the sideline and mouth pious irrelevancies and sanctimonious trivialities. In the midst of a mighty struggle to rid our nation of racial and economic injustice, I have heard many ministers say: 'Those are social issues, with which the gospel has no real concern.' And I have watched many churches commit themselves to a completely other worldly religion which makes a strange, un-Biblical distinction between body and soul, between the sacred and the secular.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

				"content_text": "<p>Reminder: the key ingredient is violent power.</p>\n<p>People are often jerks. People sometimes have frightening opinions. People do things we dislike. People can be ignorant, sometimes willfully so. People are frequently selfish.</p>\n<p>These are problematic, so we seek empathy and enlightenment. And it is good that we do.</p>\n<p>But the above are not truly damaging unless they attached to violent power.</p>\n<p>Without violent power, these issues are an opportunity for discussion and learning.</p>\n<p>But when backed by the ability to call on armed men &amp; women, the ability capture &amp; hold people, the ability to acquire with force, and the ability to strike and kill: they become coercive and potentially deadly.</p>\n<p>We cannot and should not stop educating. We cannot and should not stop furthering socialization and empathy.</p>\n<p>But we also need to be more focused on limiting violent power and the systems that coordinate it. Too often we excuse the amassing of violent power because it is done by someone with a friendly face or someone agreeable to our causes.</p>\n<p>History tells us time and again that such violent power will always be abused eventually.</p>\n<p>Immediacy is not an excuse to trust it. Tribalism is not an excuse to trust it with “our side.”</p>\n<p>We must fight being distracted by opinions and strike at the root.</p>\n<p>Fight the power.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" title=\"16299211_791986515803_2111440063166209939_n.jpg\" src=\"https://blog.grotenhuis.info/uploads/2022/eb2329212c.jpg\" alt=\"16299211 791986515803 2111440063166209939 n\" width=\"337\" height=\"479\" border=\"0\" /></p>\n",
